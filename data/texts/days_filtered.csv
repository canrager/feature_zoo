tuesday,"I have read every single comment on this post. Some were hysterical, especially about passengars pummeling a hijacker. I think it's true.

I think it's important for children to be educated about strangers, but in this case I think it's important for children to know that they parent will be there and that there is a law that says some people get searched and others don't. And that this isn't ""bad"" touching.I just want to say, I hate TSAs. Honestly, I could care less if you're just doing your job. You picked a nasty job. There is a reason I do not have your job. Because I don't want to be the one people are posting comments about on the TSA blog because I am enforcing rules I may not agree with.When I hear them say ""We're just following the rules"" or ""We may not agree with them but we have to follow them"" I feel like saying ""Then get a job that has rules and regulations you agree with""Same for soldiers. Don't state that you think this ""war"" is ridiculous and then join the Army/Navy/Marines, etc.That being said, no I don't like you, but *I* put up with *you* because I'd rather not sit on my plump rump for sixteen hours just so I can have my very own sammich made by my grammy.I take off my belt, remove my laptop from the case, take off all my outer layers, so I am left in a tank top or t-shirt.On Tuesday"
