On April 29, 1992 a jury acquitted four Los Angeles Police Department officers accused in the videotaped beating of African-American motorist Rodney King. The outrage that followed is now called the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. I was born in Pasadena, California and my youth was spent in and around the suburbs of Los Angeles. Los Angeles was my stomping grounds and I loved the city. At the time of the Rodney King trials I had been working weekly for the Los Angeles Times and that trial was definitely heating things up.

The Fête de l'Huma is the annual three-day festival held by l'Humanité, once the paper of the French Communist Party (Parti communiste français), now independent but still close to the PCF. The fête occupies a 173-acre site (that's about one-fifth the size of Central Park) and has, like any fair, a midway, vendors, panels, forums, rock concerts, and booths serving food and drinks. The primary difference between the fête and your local county fair is that the booths represent Communist parties from all over France and from around the world. For someone who grew up in a country (I mean, of course, the United States) where ""communist"" was a word for scaring children in the culture at large--a word that has since, simply, disappeared from that same culture--that difference is mind-boggling.

If I were sitting in a tube train and all the people opposite me were reading Mein Kampf with obvious enjoyment and approval it probably wouldn't disturb me much more than if they were reading Heinlein, Tolkein or Richard Adams. All this visionary fiction seems to me to have a great deal in common. Utopian fiction has been predominantly reactionary in one form or another (as well as being predominantly dull) since it began. Most of it warns the world of 'decadence' in its contemporaries and the alternatives are usually authoritarian and sweeping -- not to say simple-minded.

monday,"Shopaholics: be sure to check out Festivity's other location in Virginia-Highland! Scout Notes: Are you suffering from boutique boredom? Side effects often include deja vu (from seeing the same exact products from other boutiques around town) and credit card-swiping fatigue (from all of those ridiculous prices). Sounds like you need a little celebration in your life. A little something... shall we say... festive? Enter Festivity. Full of unique goods you won't find at any other boutiques in the city at surprisingly wallet-friendly prices, Festivity is the place to go in order to cure yourself of boutique backlash. After all, there's nothing like a little festive retail therapy to get you back in the groove. And if there was ever a perfect place in Atlanta to twirl around in a new dress or model some new bling, it's Festivity. The dresses, shoes, jewelry, and accessories are bound to make you feel like a million bucks (without wreaking quite that much havoc on your wallet). If there were such a thing as an Insta-PartyReady machine, Festivity would be it. The shop is packed with a selection of flirty frocks and fun party dresses that pretty much beckon every gal from out on the sidewalks into the store, whether she has a reason to get gussied up or not. You simply can't resist. But Festivity is much more than festive wear for the partygoer. Their selection of gifts, home goods, and accessories is just as tantalizing to shoppers as the frocks hanging from the racks. Owner and founder Colleen says that's exactly why people love Festivity: the array of goods is so diverse, it's rare that you can walk in here and walk out empty-handed. It's a place where moms and daughters can shop together in harmony, thanks to their extensive selection of diverse, fun, trendy (but not too trendy) pieces. From costume jewelry to finer pieces, the selection of baubles here has caught the eye of many a shopper, thanks in part to the sheer size of the jewelry collection (which, by the way, does include local designers, as well as designers that can't be found in any other Atlanta boutiques). Between the jewels, the dresses, the fall-ready boots, the home decor, and the gifts, there's plenty of things to celebrate at Festivity, boutiqe boredom be damned. Hours: Monday"

During the event, a number of industry experts from freelance architects to multi-disciplinary institutions, participated and gave students feedback and advice on their final year degree show.

Try to make it consistent so that after a few weeks, it becomes a habit to you and it will be more systematic in your daily life. If you are employed at a 9-5 job, it can be as easy as going to the gym before or after work every day. I usually go to the gym right after I get off work and one day a weekend.

We have the ability to deliver the development of the private sector, particularly the small and medium-sized enterprises which drive job creation and thus supplement the efforts of other international financial institutions which focus on public infrastructure.”European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton told Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit that the EU will permit new loans and provide “expertise” if Egypt ‘willing to make the necessary economic reforms’ in order to get them. Meanwhile new parties are being formed through Facebook to counter, and crowd out traditionally popular organizations like the Muslim Brotherhood. New Parties like the “25th of January Party” — no indication of what it stands for in the name — has garnered hundreds of thousands of “likes”. Another Party, the “Freedom and Justice Party” is a magnet for a secular pro-free-market Egyptians looking for power and position in the new Egypt. But a hundred other parties are being financed, each directed at peeling away one or more demographic groupings from the Muslim Brotherhood. This important work is proceeding as the world is distracted by the violence in Libya. By the time the world is ready to look at Egypt again, the nation will show an entirely different political landscape. It is clear that the little people have lost again, that Egyptians have lost their revolution and that the people simply are not well enough informed to raise up their own alternative to domination by International Finance. The so-called Egyptian revolution has been hijacked by the Rothschilds while the world has shifted its eyes to Libya. Meanwhile, Citi Group and the global banking elite continue formulating and farming their emerging markets: “Citi has unveiled what it dubs the ‘3G’ countries: Global Growth Generators. The 11 countries it picks out as leading lights are Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Mongolia, Nigeria, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.” - The Wall Street Journal 2-24-2011 The closure of Egypt’s banks for two of the past three weeks has added strain on an economy already reeling from the evaporation of tourism and a prolonged stock market closure caused by the political upheaval that ousted long-time leader Hosni Mubarak. The bank shutdown and the draining of ATM machines have paralyzed businesses and left ordinary people scrambling for cash. The country’s banks had long been a source of pride for Egyptians, with its strong regulatory environment and their lack of investments in the kind of toxic assets that hammered Western banks helped Egypt weather the worst of the global financial meltdown. Two weeks Moody’s Investors Service downgraded its credit ratings for five Egyptian banks. Future loans from international agencies will depend on eliminating those regulations and meeting other benchmarks for “free-market reform”. BANK HOLIDAY: ORDER OUT OF CHAOS Banks remained open the first few days of the 18-day democracy uprising. But after a weekend of looting, arson and lawlessness on Jan. 28-29, they closed for a week and many ATMs ran out of cash. The following week, the banks closed. They reopened the week of Feb. 6-10 and this week on Sunday. The military-led caretaker government has sought to re-establish a measure of normalcy after Mubarak’s ousting. Banks reopened on Sunday and officials breathed a sigh of relief when a much-feared run on them did not materialize— the first weekday following Mubarak’s exit. They closed again on Monday"

EuropaCorp has made a U.S. distribution deal with Cohen Media Group for the Luc Besson-directed The Lady, the story of Burmese pro-democracy activist and political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi. Upstart Cohen Media Group plans to release the film for an Oscar-qualifying platform release late this year to capitalize on strong performances by Michelle Yeoh, who plays Suu Kyi, and David Thewlis, who plays her Oxford professor husband Michael Aris. The film will get a wider release in early 2012. Suu Kyi has spent most of the last 20 years under house arrest by the repressive Burmese military-controlled government. Leaders cruelly barred her husband and two sons from visiting her, thinking that it would drive her to leave. Because she knew that once gone she would never be permitted re-entry, Suu Kyi sacrificed everything to stay and become an iconic symbol of democracy and human rights. Her husband and sons bolstered her spirit and campaigned for the Nobel Peace Prize, which she was awarded in 1991. The distribution deals came quickly after the film premiered Monday"

At the time, what was trending was an interview from a woman claiming to be Osama Bin Laden's mistress. She said he was a big fan of Whitney Houston. My first thought was the CIA should work with Houston, have a private concert and invite Bin Laden, some of his closest friends in Al Qaeda and their laptops and then do what the CIA does. Ned Foster thought my idea was crazy and until I found a Washington Post column that suggested the same thing. And that, folks is how the Click Chick was born.

monday,"Even if an individual is found to be a responsible person within the meaning of Sec. 6672(a), the section imposes no liability on him unless his failure to collect, account for, or remit the withholding taxes was ""willful[ ]."" To be willful, conduct need not stem from an ""evil motive or intent to defraud,"" Kalb v. United States, 505 F.2d 506, 511 (2d Cir.1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 979, 95 S.Ct. 1981, 44 L.Ed.2d 471 (1975); but it must amount to more than negligence, see id. The principal component of willfulness is knowledge: a responsible person acted willfully within the meaning of Sec. 6672(a) if he (a) knew of the company's obligation to pay withholding taxes, and (b) knew that company funds were being used for other purposes instead. See, e.g., Hochstein, 900 F.2d at 548; United States v. Running, 7 F.3d 1293, 1298 (7th Cir.1993) (""a responsible person acts willfully when he permits funds of the corporation to be paid to other creditors when he is aware that withholding taxes due to the government have not been paid""). Thus, failures were ""willful[ ]"" within the meaning of Sec. 6672(a) if they were "" 'voluntary, conscious and intentional--as opposed to accidental--decisions not to remit funds properly withheld to the Government.'

monday,"I think it's a waste if this Todd-on-Todd rivalry does not carry over onto Prospect Park Media's ""OLTL 2.0."" I feel TSJ's Todd is the ultimate darkness in Howarth's Todd carried out to the nth degree while remaining functional -- he has become a cautionary tale of what Howarth's Todd must never become, and has always fought against succumbing to. The men are like night and day in many ways in their performances, yet they represent two sides of one character. One is the real man, one the imitation, but the latter came to embody his role more than either of them probably ever could have imagined, in a very Victor Lord sort of way. Yet St. John's Todd, for all that darkness, clearly still loves and cares about certain things and people, in his own mad way, even if I often feel it's mostly for what they can do for him as objects or treasures. There's a gold mine of future story in that, if anyone is listening and if Trevor St. John gets bored and decides to come back to Llanview.

I'll sign right now and you've got a deal-- I did this and got $300 off because I decided I wanted roof racks and wheel locks and they wanted to compensate me for it). That moment right before you sign and have spent hours negotiating is crucial, you can use it your favor -always- or walk.

It's healthy to laugh at yourself, right? =) Honestly I was having fun and I didn't care much. But I do have one question. Where do you people find this flexibility? Is there an online store or something? I need to add that to the shopping list! And shoes!! I need new shoes too! My shoes didn't do much for me. That was frustrating.

monday,Thanks for taking the time out of your extremely busy wine making schedule thank you for having me where are you in the wind process right now I'm hoping here some warm weather stories because I just heard we're getting a foot of snow tomorrow here in Boston. No warm weather stories for you at the moment. Everything. From 2011 is now and or Gerald -- and awaiting its. It's time. And you're sitting -- and barrel or so and and we'll get put in the bottle. Two tours while we. How many seasons is this now say they you've gone through wine making. If you count the planting. Initial breaking ground and -- all that together in 2002 -- Almost ten years. So what are the biggest lessons you've learned in the in the last ten years that that. You maybe you thought you knew what you what you're getting into ten years ago and now you look back and say how we didn't know anything. We initially. Northern Arizona would be we would have problems with he -- can that we were having more problems with cold. Just is expected as a snowstorm on Halloween weekend here in Boston I -- true. True are you scheduling all maturing now around all the work at the vineyard yes so how did you find time to record the producer for album in there. Well we did them mostly in the spring is everything in the spring everything is being handled by -- -- -- cruises involving the pro name. Of the -- sending. Training and one. It's all happening in the vineyard so. I'm more the -- -- In the bunker. And that scientists. There's plenty of time to write to court to bring. I've seen if you YouTube videos from some different like wine blogs and stuff and it really seems like. You're being embraced by that the wine community was that a surprise to you. -- you know what would wind it's there's definitely a a hierarchy. Of expectation. But when you open a bottle you don't tell them you're from and they try to how you know it's. Experience. They can't really denies there's something happening. The truth is in the -- We should. So that's been easy to. Critics. Wind. That there's something going on and his that by pouring in the long line. Which it's kind of what California had to do with the international wine community way back in the day. You know and that's. They jumped that hurdle that basically put it the okay so much did a -- for the blind tasting in one. And that's kind of what we're doing something is on the line. We're doing really well. I know -- taken a lot of inspiration from Arizona and from that whole geographic area for it was a first can you explain to me that the different writing process and the different inspiration process for all the different projects that you have. You know just everything is different conversation with a different a different group of people a different year. Meadowlands and to try to -- the same -- -- for years with about four different ways depending on where you are in your life we feel. When you're putting the Christopher torrent together because when you look at the credits there's so many different moving parts. How do you guys logistically go about taking all that stuff and making it logistically possible. To take on the road and set up and tear down in the same day in different venues. It basically it could take one step at a time and pretty much the only way to do it planning. Paying attention to what works. For which. When it comes to that touring musician and as opposed to everybody that worked on the album is at the same or -- to make changes. Generally speaking our core group of people you know -- Mitchell and myself and Josh used this screen around. Jeffrey -- Johnson for the most part we have you know. The decision like coming goes depending on the city but so logistically we try to take out everybody last time and that didn't work two just to me to me people. I talk to Perry Farrell from Jane's Addiction last week and asked him he is recording style with a lot of digital capabilities as compared to like say Dave Grohl on the Foo Fighters going into garage and going all analog. Where does your. View on technology recording said. Well unless you're an absolute audio files -- I could tell you that this thing was recordable analogue. You would believe me. I think in the day if you can afford to. You analogue means there's great. We can't for the very expensive. Long process. -- and when you wanted to do when you have people listening to it. As an MP3 through your book. -- work it would bother. We I mean we do we take every we just extra steps to make it sound the best -- can possibly be put out. Punto -- we before or ranges. Mattresses. You -- gateway. Luckily because he's. -- -- genius but there for the most part for the long term here I would challenge. First. There seems to be a huge resurgence at least appear regionally. With like Newbury comics where vinyl is just. In becoming the cool medium all over again and they're selling a ton of vinyl bands like you guys are printing vinyl do you listen to it at home still. Yeah I have two turntable. And definitely. I -- -- my old vinyl. When a projected high school. What would people be surprised that you have on vinyl in your collection because there's some embarrassing stuff in my vinyl collection. He's -- Brothers I everybody has that. People with the wolverines -- vendor on one side of the comedy on the other yeah yeah. I can do -- pick a second and thank Newbury comics for the support. And and and record stores like that that are independent source says this is a completely independent project. You'll find -- the best buy or target. People like you would radios or so. We'd like people. Still keep it real. -- Regionally we're very lucky to have Newbury comics appear. Well you're right your brain plus deferred to the -- on November 22 and all of the the ticket information is -- WA AF dot com. And I I put out on FaceBook and on Twitter which I've noticed your very active on. I was asking people for some some questions a camera down a couple of them before you go sure I don't know if this woman is spying on you through your windows. But she said if you have elevators in your house which I guess you know as you do and who do you have a fire evacuation plan. If I if I have elevators in my necessary. But. It the way she said it made it sound like she knew it for a fact that's I asked. And that's where people. The fact backpack. A few people actually -- me ask you about how you're Brazilian jujitsu training was going. It which leads me to question that I have about the conditions of my parole video what did you eat in training for those midriff shown enough video. Popcorn. I hear the fact that that the. It depends that is completely -- your stomach. Kind of went overboard with the just the nature that we made that the effect was fully self. No they would ever allow herself to be recorded on video especially HD video from sabathia angles and that video. Or sport. And that the ghost towns that are out around your vineyard -- -- me ask you if you've had any kind of strange experience is just kind of roaming around out there. Yes do you want to elaborate at all or no. Like we there are generally dislike you know if he's broken down American -- -- in book -- the thing with the drive. So it's not like it again it goes to counters it's scary -- encounters it goes in it's kind of thing -- what you hear this. Action. That the that the do you dress up for Halloween since she dressed up so much for your regular job and if so what's the best Halloween costume you've ever worn -- -- You'll have to look and see on Monday

I think it's important for children to be educated about strangers, but in this case I think it's important for children to know that they parent will be there and that there is a law that says some people get searched and others don't. And that this isn't ""bad"" touching.I just want to say, I hate TSAs. Honestly, I could care less if you're just doing your job. You picked a nasty job. There is a reason I do not have your job. Because I don't want to be the one people are posting comments about on the TSA blog because I am enforcing rules I may not agree with.When I hear them say ""We're just following the rules"" or ""We may not agree with them but we have to follow them"" I feel like saying ""Then get a job that has rules and regulations you agree with""Same for soldiers. Don't state that you think this ""war"" is ridiculous and then join the Army/Navy/Marines, etc.That being said, no I don't like you, but *I* put up with *you* because I'd rather not sit on my plump rump for sixteen hours just so I can have my very own sammich made by my grammy.I take off my belt, remove my laptop from the case, take off all my outer layers, so I am left in a tank top or t-shirt.On Tuesday"

tuesday,"One of the most exciting Quarterfinal Playoffs clashes in recent history will be decided one way or another on Wednesday when CSKA Moscow hosts Olympiacos Piraeus in deciding Game 3 in the Russian capital. Olympiacos stunned CSKA in Game 1 74-76 on Lynn Greer’s buzzer-beating jump shot, but CSKA evened the score in Game 2 in Athens as the trio of Matjaz Smodis, Trajan Langdon and Ramunas Siskauskas shined in a 73-83 victory. Now both teams will pull out all the stops and try to put their best foot forward to clinch a spot at next month’s Final Four in Madrid. History favors CSKA, as not only have head coach Ettore Messina’s charges been to a record five consecutive Final Fours, but never before had the Russian champs lost a playoff game at home and the odds of that happening twice in eight days are slim. Furthermore, never before has a Euroleague Basketball series seen all the games go to the visiting team. On the other hand, the Reds have reasons for optimism. Head coach Panagiotis Giannakis’s charges have shown plenty of mental toughness recently, including winning their last three road games at some tough arenas. Additionally, Olympiacos forward Qyntel Woods has been hot lately on both ends of the floor and his Game 1 defensive showing against reigning Euroleague MVP Theo Papaloukas was a main reason for the outcome of that contest. However the Reds, who have battled injuries all season long, will be shorthanded again as Arvydas Macijauskas and Kostas Vasileadis are out against CSKA. A key statistic in the series thus far has been three-point shooting. CSKA was below its average with just 36.8% in its Game 1 loss, but made 54.5% in the Game 2 win. Meanwhile Olympiacos shot 50% from downtown in Moscow, but 37.5% in Athens. If any of the many sharpshooters on either side heats up in Game 3, it could prove to be a major factor between these defensive minded sides. CSKA will look to its experience to help get through this challenge as it can boast a roster with eight players that won the Euroleague title with the club two years ago. Olympiacos will look to Greer to lead the team, with Woods, Rod Blakney and reserves Georgios Printezis and Ioannis Bouroussis asked to rise to the occasion. All signs point to a tense and low-scoring defensive battle, however with so many excellent offensive players on the floor, one man’s brilliance can make the difference in a series whose outcome will shape two teams’ entire season.

The crumb is softer from that formulation. I really didnít want to go to 75% hydration, but since it seems to give a better crumb structure and tenderness, I guess I will try that at market for a bigger batch next week. So far I like the 9.5 oz dough ball weight for the 4-square and 19 oz of dough for the 8-square, unless we find out more about Buddyís dough ball weights. I like the ďdouble kneadingĒ method with the rest period in so far because it made the dough less sticky at home. I havenít tried the higher hydration at market with ďdouble kneadingĒ and a rest period, but think it might work about the same as it did when I mixed the dough at home. This is only for me at market, but the dough seems to hold up well all day, which I am glad about. I didnít want to have to make any dough on Tuesday"

Meanwhile new parties are being formed through Facebook to counter, and crowd out traditionally popular organizations like the Muslim Brotherhood. New Parties like the “25th of January Party” — no indication of what it stands for in the name — has garnered hundreds of thousands of “likes”. Another Party, the “Freedom and Justice Party” is a magnet for a secular pro-free-market Egyptians looking for power and position in the new Egypt. But a hundred other parties are being financed, each directed at peeling away one or more demographic groupings from the Muslim Brotherhood. This important work is proceeding as the world is distracted by the violence in Libya. By the time the world is ready to look at Egypt again, the nation will show an entirely different political landscape. It is clear that the little people have lost again, that Egyptians have lost their revolution and that the people simply are not well enough informed to raise up their own alternative to domination by International Finance. The so-called Egyptian revolution has been hijacked by the Rothschilds while the world has shifted its eyes to Libya. Meanwhile, Citi Group and the global banking elite continue formulating and farming their emerging markets: “Citi has unveiled what it dubs the ‘3G’ countries: Global Growth Generators. The 11 countries it picks out as leading lights are Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Mongolia, Nigeria, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.” - The Wall Street Journal 2-24-2011 The closure of Egypt’s banks for two of the past three weeks has added strain on an economy already reeling from the evaporation of tourism and a prolonged stock market closure caused by the political upheaval that ousted long-time leader Hosni Mubarak. The bank shutdown and the draining of ATM machines have paralyzed businesses and left ordinary people scrambling for cash. The country’s banks had long been a source of pride for Egyptians, with its strong regulatory environment and their lack of investments in the kind of toxic assets that hammered Western banks helped Egypt weather the worst of the global financial meltdown. Two weeks Moody’s Investors Service downgraded its credit ratings for five Egyptian banks. Future loans from international agencies will depend on eliminating those regulations and meeting other benchmarks for “free-market reform”. BANK HOLIDAY: ORDER OUT OF CHAOS Banks remained open the first few days of the 18-day democracy uprising. But after a weekend of looting, arson and lawlessness on Jan. 28-29, they closed for a week and many ATMs ran out of cash. The following week, the banks closed. They reopened the week of Feb. 6-10 and this week on Sunday. The military-led caretaker government has sought to re-establish a measure of normalcy after Mubarak’s ousting. Banks reopened on Sunday and officials breathed a sigh of relief when a much-feared run on them did not materialize— the first weekday following Mubarak’s exit. They closed again on Monday, the central bank ordering them to remain shut at least until the start of next week on Sunday. A week ago, Credit Suisse estimated that the unrest had cost the country at least $310 million per day, and predicted the Egyptian currency would come under heavy pressure as investors shifted to dollar deposits or pulled their money out entirely. Those projections for economic growth this year were quickly revised down from 6 percent, to between 2 and 4 percent respectively. The European Investment Bank (EIB) , on Tuesday"

Drawn to Buddhism in his early 20s, after completing his university studies he traveled to Sri Lanka, where he received novice ordination in 1972 and full ordination in 1973, both under the late Ven. Ananda Maitreya, the leading Sri Lankan scholar-monk of recent times. He was appointed editor of the Buddhist Publication Society (in Sri Lanka) in 1984 and its president in 1988. Ven. Bodhi has many important publications to his credit, either as author, translator, or editor, including The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha — A Translation of the Majjhima Nikaya (co-translated with Ven. Bhikkhu Nanamoli, 1995) and The Connected Discourses of the Buddha — a New Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya (2000) In May 2000 he gave the keynote address at the United Nations on its first official celebration of Vesak (the day of the Buddha's birth, enlightenment, and passing away).

tuesday,"--The halftime ceremony to honor Jerry Colangelo was almost 30 minutes long, which no doubt affected the Cavs at the start of the second half. There was a really cool montage as this jazz musician played a long version of My Way and Colangelo's speech was emotional but everything else could've been cut. That includes Kevin Johnson, who mocked Cleveland just for fun, and Dan Majerle, who told a five minute story that was pretty lame. LeBron said it messed with the team but it is no excuse, which is the proper attitude because the Suns had to sit through it too, but it changed momentum without a doubt. --The Cavs got very passive on offense early in the second half when they lost their lead. Guys were passing up wide open shots. That's not how you play against the Suns. You can't shoot too fast, though, and they didn't manage the offense well. --The Suns don't foul a lot, but it's still a little hard to believe LeBron couldn't have gotten more than two free throw attempts. He needed 26 shots for his 27 points, that's not effective. Overall, the offense wasn't effective in the half court and on most nights right now, it just isn't going to be. Been ringing that bells for years now. --Drew Gooden and Zydrunas Ilgauskas both looked a little tired at the end, they Suns were beating them to rebounds.

Though he seems modern in every age—modern all over again—he seems especially modern in ours, when we look at him from the angle of analytical philosophy, a school of thought which has, at its tutorial center, a concern for scrupulosity of language: the scrupulosity that was incarnated by Wittgenstein, and as much in his likes as his dislikes. Wittgenstein’s admiration for Mörike depended on the poet’s determination that the word should not exceed the thing.

If there is any echo at all, it is not from ""the rabid right"" but Alexis de Tocqueville's Democracy in America:""A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world's greatest civilizations has been 200 years.""We've proudly passed our 200 years but de Tocqueville's prospect has never anticipated my state, the nation, and our new Congress and President more vividly. In fact neither the For norAgainst Proposition 30 arguments in the State's official voting guide mentioned that taxing the 1% exclusively to pay for the 99% was a point to consider.

tuesday,"I must first tell you, that I have been at work, and, I think, to good purpose, at Dorking. Last year I did something considerable towards the exposition of all the phenomena classed under the title of Thought. I have pursued the subject, during the last few weeks; and all the phenomena called intellectual, (still leaving the moral) have undergone investigation. You know my opinion was, that they might all be expounded upon the principles of Hartley, and might be satisfactorily shewn to be nothing but sensations, and the ideas, the copies of these sensations, combined in groups by association. I think I have now made this satisfactory exposition; that I have not left one point doubtful, or likely to be disputed but by those who lie under the dominion of previous associations, and are not capable of the degree of attention which is necessary to break their fetters. After explaining, in an elementary manner, the phenomena of sensation, and the representations of sensations, the ideas, and also the laws of association, and the artifice of naming, I proceed to apply these elements, and examine how far they go in accounting for all the complicated phenomena, included under the titles, Imagination, Memory, Belief, Judgement, Ratiocination, Abstraction, and so on. No body has seen the papers but John, whose mind however is perfectly ripe to judge of them: and to him the expositions appear to be easy of comprehension, and perfectly satisfactory. I doubt not that they will appear equally so to you. I confess that the evidence has turned out to be shorter, more simple, and conclusive, by far, than I had dared to anticipate. I should like to have your opinion of it; and if I can get it copied, so that you would be able to read it, I will send it to you. The whole is within a very narrow compass; and it will need to be a good deal dilated, and made familiar by illustrations, in writing it afresh for the public. In its present shape, the analysis is given in the naked state in which it presented itself to me, as I advanced step by step.—I mean to go on, next, to the exposition of the Will, and the different phenomena commonly classed under it, the desires, passions, &. c., called the “active Powers of the mind”, by the Scotch and other philosophers. This will be easy; and when this is done, the whole of what we call mind will be explained. I shall then look upon myself as having rendered no small service to the cause of light. I got so full of my subject, that I could not tear myself away from Dorking. There was, however, another reason. For as it is necessary that McCulloch and I should so arrange our matters, that one of us shall always be here; and as business came on which rendered it impossible for him to go away at the time which had been originally settled between him and me, that so I might have the half of my holidays now, and the other half to go to Gatcomb with, the latter half of September; I lost nothing by staying at Dorking: for now the time of my getting to Gatcomb will be necessarily postponed for some weeks beyond the time when I hoped I could be with you, and as my stay will also be shortened I shall make my run down to you by my single self. I shall have an ostensible week for you, which I shall make all but two; for I can come off by the night coach on a wednesday evening; and I can be with you all the evening of the next tuesday"

tuesday,"The GOP just blocked the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell in the Senate, and the immediate conclusion to be drawn is that this is yet more proof that GOP obstructionism works brilliantly. It fires up the GOP base, while simultaneously demoralizing Dems who want their leaders to prevail despite the GOP tactics.Well, maybe. The problem is that while the Democrats are in fact losing (apparently) on this one, that hasn't always been the case, to say the least, during this Congress. When the Democrats did pass the stimulus and health care reform, the result was...a fired up GOP base, and if not a demoralized group of Democrats, at least no noticeable surge in Dem enthusiasm. Same results! While I think it's true that Republican rejectionism has prevented passage of some bills (and thus has some important substantive consequences), I'd stick with structural reasons and chronic Democratic habits to explain the effects Sargent is trying to explain. I'm really not convinced at all that rejectionism does the GOP much electoral good beyond that. Tuesday"""

tuesday,"Tue Aug. 28, 2012 Josh Mandel is the boyish-faced, factually-challenged Republican candidate vying to unseat Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). Until last weekend, Mandel had refused to stake out a clear position on what had become a key issue in this Rust Belt race: whether Congress was right to rescue auto manufacturers General Motors and Chrysler with a $15 billion federal bailout. It was a glaring omission for Mandel, a national candidate in a battleground state where the automotive industry employs upwards of 140,000 Ohioans. In a joint interview with Brown on Sunday, however, Mandel broke his silence in a big way. He called Brown ""un-American"" for voting in favor of the auto industry bailout, claiming that non-union retirees at Delphi, a GM parts supplier, got screwed out of of their pensions because of the government bailouts. (As PolitiFact notes, that's not quite true.) There's a big problem with branding a yes vote on the auto bailout ""un-American"": The presumptive vice-presidential nominee for Mandel's own party, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.), voted yes for that same bailout. Is Ryan un-American, too? I put that question to Mandel spokesman Travis Considine in an email early Tuesday"

The British historian, David Irving, who has been widely vilified for questioning whether 6m Jews were killed by the Nazis - and who believes that Hitler knew nothing of the Final Solution until late in the war - is suing an American academic for claiming that he is a 'Hitler partisan' who twists history to cast the German dictator in a better light. Deborah Lipstadt , professor of modern Jewish and Holocaust studies at Emory university in Atlanta, Georgia, accused Mr Irving of being one of the most prominent and dangerous 'Holocaust deniers' in the world in her book Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault On Truth and Memory, published by Penguin four years ago.

tuesday,"Forget about the Whiteout and the overtime thrillers and the transformation of men with beards into gleeful little boys. Yes, the Stanley Cup playoffs are a celebration of all that. But in Phoenix -- for the last three years -- they've also been a distraction from an ownership saga that reached its four-year anniversary Sunday. The Coyotes were excluded from the postseason party this spring and now the off-ice problems have stolen the spotlight, casting a menacing pall over off-season proceedings because the group that finished the season could look very different from the one that will reconvene in the fall -- wherever that may be. Coach Dave Tippett's contract is set to expire, as is General Manger Don Maloney's. Goalie Mike Smith and center Boyd Gordon headline the team's class of pending unrestricted free agents. Many predict a resolution in the coming months, and the changes -- from the roster to the location -- could be drastic. And yet tethered to the franchise is captain Shane Doan, who hasn't regretted his decision to sign a four-year contract last summer to remain with the Coyotes amid this uncertainty. ""Not at all,"" he said. ""Not at all. Not once have I ever thought that. The group of guys in here is the reason why. Obviously I'm a huge fan of the city, the Valley. The organization has been great to me. But the group of guys that are in this room, that's why you choose to stay and you stay."" If anyone should feel betrayed by the ongoing ownership drama, it's Doan. He cemented his loyalty to the franchise by agreeing to stay while turning down offers for more stability from Stanley Cup contenders. Doan has said the Coyotes were always going to be his pick, but he did communicate regularly with potential buyer Greg Jamison last summer when Jamison was confident his bid to purchase the team would be successful. Jamison had a deadline of Jan.31 to complete the purchase of the team to save a lucrative arena management deal with the City of Glendale and once the deadline passed without a resolution, the ownership situation was hard to ignore because the players were aware of that deadline. ""I think it was disappointing when it never worked out,"" Doan said. ""It didn't get done when we thought it was. I think because everyone kind of got pretty excited about the fact that it was going to get done and it didn't made it a little tougher. But we've dealt with it in the past, and it's amazing the way the guys have handled it and unfortunately we didn't handle it as well this year."" The ownership instability didn't prevent the Coyotes from re-signing Doan, but it could very well sever the team's relationship with Smith. Negotiations between Smith's camp and the Coyotes have been hampered by the uncertainty as Smith wants to know where he'll be playing long-term. ""I think it affects the group more in the fact of players you want to sign,"" Tippett said. ""Maybe they're here that you want to sign longer-term, and you can't get signed so they're wondering where their future is. ""The unique situation with Shane, there's not many players in sports right now that would take that leap of faith right now. That was a very unique situation. But you have lots of other players on our team that in a normal situation on a normal team that's owned, they would probably be signed."" Since Jamison's bid fizzled, other suitors have emerged. The favorite is Renaissance Sports & Entertainment. That group was supposed to meet with Glendale officials and league representatives Tuesday"

Hey, eating durians with a spoon is a great idea, you don't have to put up with stinky fingers later on! The first thing we noticed about the durian is that it doesn't smell. It does give out a little bit of smell but it wasn't overpowering, like how fresh Malaysian durians are. That kinda sucks a little, but I guess that's what you can expect from frozen Thai durians. Even though the flesh was quite firm and sweet, it was a bit watery. I am guessing it's also because the durian was frozen during shipping. Overall, I would say that it wasn't really half as bad as I expected it to be. Nothing close to the fresh durians that you can get back home in Malaysia though.

The lengthy discussion written by Corsi asks if men are just ""randomly crazy, or are they pushed?"". ""The fact is that women are increasingly the cause...and end up exacerbating tensions by leaving children to themselves, keep dirty houses, put cold dishes on the table, buy fast food and provide filthy clothes. So if a family goes to the dogs and is pushed to crime (violence must be condemned and punished firmly) often the responsibilities are shared"".

wednesday,"The same can't be said for the Tampa Bay Rays -- the hottest team in baseball.One day after their chances for the AL East title took a major hit, the Orioles continue their push for the top wild-card spot Tuesday night against the recently eliminated Rays.Baltimore (92-68) officially clinched a wild-card berth Sunday but entered this three-game series with its sights set on its first division crown since 1997. However, a 5-3 loss Monday coupled with the Yankees' 10-2 rout of Boston made that goal much more difficult as it fell one game behind New York with two to play.""We didn't take care of our business,"" center fielder Adam Jones said. ""We lost. When it comes to the Yankees, we can't control them. We can't control if they win or lose.""Matt Wieters hit a solo homer and Chris Davis continued his power surge with a two-run shot in the ninth, but the Orioles had their four-game win streak snapped. They dropped into a tie with Oakland for the top wild card, which would include home-field advantage for that one-game playoff.Although the Rays (89-71) staved off elimination for a few hours with their 11th win in 12 games, they were ousted from contention when the Athletics beat Texas.""Honestly, it just is what it is,"" Rays manager Joe Maddon said. ""We had opportunities early in the year to win more games, and we did not. But so did everybody else.""Maddon said he's thought about lineup changes for the final two games now that his team has been eliminated.Third baseman Evan Longoria, still dealing with a partially torn left hamstring, may have played his final game of the year.""I've thought about talking to certain guys that are banged up,"" he told the team's official website. ""That's my only thought.""Davis has homered in a career-best five straight games, with six total and 12 RBIs during that span. He's 3 for 9 with one home run against scheduled starter James Shields.The last player to homer in six consecutive games was Rays first baseman Carlos Pena from June 6-12, 2010, and the last Orioles player to do it was Reggie Jackson in 1976.Miguel Gonzalez (8-4, 3.45 ERA) wouldn't mind if Davis matches Jackson as he tries to win three consecutive starts for the first time.The rookie right-hander was sharp again Wednesday"

She was 69.Abrams was married to TV-movie producer and former exec Gerald Abrams and was the mother of multihyphenate J.J. Abrams and scribe Tracy Rosen. Carol Ann Abrams developed and was an executive producer of the Disney Channel’s “The Ernest Green Story” (1993), about the forced integration at Central High in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957. The film premiered at Central High, where it was introduced by President-Elect Bill Clinton, and went on to win a Peabody Award. Abrams produced two other telepics, “Second Honeymoon” and “Two Against Time,” both for CBS. The latter film starred Marlo Thomas and Ellen Muth in the story of a mother and daughter both diagnosed with cancer. But Abrams’ attention turned to writing, and she co-authored two books, “Grandparents & Grandchildren” and “Teen Knitting Club.” Abrams was born in New York City and graduated from Penn State U. with honors.

wednesday,"[ 078 ] While the ladies were thus conversing, there came into the church three young men, young, I say, but not so young that the age of the youngest was less than twenty-five years; in whom neither the sinister course of events, nor the loss of friends or kinsfolk, nor fear for their own safety, had availed to quench, or even temper, the ardour of their love. [ 079 ] The first was called Pamfilo, the second Filostrato, and the third Dioneo. Very debonair and chivalrous were they all; and in this troublous time they were seeking if haply, to their exceeding great solace, they might have sight of their fair friends, all three of whom chanced to be among the said seven ladies, besides some that were of kin to the young men. [ 080 ] At one and the same moment they recognised the ladies and were recognised by them: wherefore, with a gracious smile, Pampinea thus began: “ Lo, fortune is propitious to our enterprise, having vouchsafed us the good offices of these young men, who are as gallant as they are discreet, and will gladly give us their guidance and escort, so we but take them into our service. ” [ 081 ] Whereupon Neifile, crimson from brow to neck with the blush of modesty, being one of those that had a lover among the young men, said: [ 082 ] “ For God's sake, Pampinea, have a care what you say. Well assured am I that nought but good can be said of any of them, and I deem them fit for office far more onerous than this which you propose for them, and their good and honourable company worthy of ladies fairer by far and more tenderly to be cherished than such as we. [ 083 ] But 'tis no secret that they love some of us here; wherefore I misdoubt that, if we take them with us, we may thereby give occasion for scandal and censure merited neither by us nor by them. ” [ 084 ] “ That, ” said Filomena, “ is of no consequence; so I but live honestly, my conscience gives me no disquietude; if others asperse me, God and the truth will take arms in my defence. [ 085 ] Now, should they be disposed to attend us, of a truth we might say with Pampinea, that fortune favours our enterprise. ” [ 086 ] The silence which followed betokened consent on the part of the other ladies, who then with one accord resolved to call the young men, and acquaint them with their purpose, and pray them to be of their company. [ 087 ] So without further parley Pampinea, who had a kinsman among the young men, rose and approached them where they stood intently regarding them; and greeting them gaily, she opened to them their plan, and besought them on the part of herself and her friends to join their company on terms of honourable and fraternal comradeship. [ 088 ] At first the young men thought she did but trifle with them; but when they saw that she was in earnest, they answered with alacrity that they were ready, and promptly, even before they left the church, set matters in train for their departure. [ 089 ] So all things meet being first sent forward in due order to their intended place of sojourn, the ladies with some of their maids, and the three young men, each attended by a man-servant, sallied forth of the city on the morrow, being Wednesday"

That’s not saying that those called to Attic traditions and those to Spartan tradition and those to Boeotian tradition, and that Platonists and Epicureans and Cynics and Pythagoreans must now all be “Pan-Hellenes”, quite the contrary; we can all be and remain our own things, but if we expect community to actually grow, then it can only work if, outside our oikos practise, we concentrate on what brings us together than what makes us different.

The JRFC included questions about the type of facility, such as detention center, training school, ranch, or group home. This information was complemented by a series of questions about other residential services provided by the facility, such as independent living, foster care, or other arrangements. In 2002, the JRFC used two modules to collect information on the substance abuse treatment and mental health treatment provided to youth in these facilities. While not evaluating the effectiveness or quality of these services, the JRFC gathered important information about the youth the services were directed toward and how the services were provided. The census indicated the use of screenings or tests conducted to determine counseling, education, health, or substance abuse needs, and also examined prominent issues about conditions of confinement, including the restraint of youth and improper absences from the facility.

Why the hell didn't anyone else use it? By the way, the movie was made available in both silent and sound versions and this appears to be a silent section that the correct soundtrack was synced to. For the silent version, many of the production numbers were cut or abridged--thus the choppy nature of the muscial sequences. Wednesday"""

Atlanta has won five of six heading into a regular season-ending three-game trip.""We're finally meshing,"" guard Armintie Price said Tuesday after a 77-61 victory over Seattle. ""It's late in the season to do it. But the best time to do it.""The Dream, a season-best three games above .500, can match the franchise record for wins set in 2011 if they win out, but a title is the goal after they were swept in the finals each of the last two postseasons.While Atlanta will likely need big production from Angel McCoughtry, the league's leading scorer with 21.7 points per game, the club has played well lately with McCoughtry coming off the bench following a two-game absence for personal reasons and a two-game ban for violating an unspecified team rule.""(Coming off the bench is) what I did in the Olympics,"" said McCoughtry, a gold medal winner with the U.S. team. ""It doesn't matter.""What does matter is that the Dream are sharing the ball and getting everyone involved. Of their 197 field goals in the last six games, 117 have come off assists. Atlanta recorded 20 assists on 29 field goals Tuesday.""The team shared the basketball again,"" said coach Fred Williams, who is 5-2 since taking over for the fired Marynell Meadors. ""It's starting to come for us. We want to play that kind of basketball and play well.""The Dream have played that way in three matchups with the Mystics (5-25) in 2012, handing out 68 assists on 100 field goals and winning by an average of 20.0 points.Lindsey Harding is averaging team highs with 15.7 points and 6.3 assists in those contests after scoring 15 points with nine assists in Atlanta's 93-68 home win Sunday.Atlanta is shooting 50.3 percent from the field against Washington this season, which is not surprising given the Mystics' field goal defense (46.6 percent) is the second-worst in the league.If Washington is going to salvage a game against the Dream this season, it will likely have to put together a more complete effort than in Wednesday"

Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY) quickly realized they could not afford to match the effort, and first broached with her the notion of dipping into her personal bank account. ""The campaign faced a strategic decision -- either attempt to match his TV . . . or lose,"" said a senior Clinton adviser, who spoke about the internal discussions on the condition of anonymity. ""I would say given the result of Super Tuesday, it was the right decision."" The $5 million loan telegraphed for the first time that the Clinton campaign, which raised more than $100 million in 2007, had suddenly hit the financial skids. What campaign aides have described as a ""temporary cash-flow problem"" left Clinton unable to match Obama's advertising in upcoming primary states for much of this week. It also made some of Clinton's top donors, in key states such as Texas, uneasy. But donations are again flowing into the Clinton campaign which will start airing television ads in several critical states today. Evan Tracey, an analyst who monitors political advertising, confirmed that the Clinton team had placed new orders for ads in Maine, Nebraska and Washington state. But Obama has had commercials airing for several days in large television markets in the District, Maryland and Virginia, as well as Louisiana, Nebraska and Washington state, Tracey said.

Babcock says that he went to Hasek after the 2nd goal and he wasn't ready, so he went back to him after the 3rd goal and he was able to get ready and stretch, and he was slightly concerned about Hasek not getting enough warm-ups in, but the Wings were good for the first 10-12 minutes of Hasek's appearance. He feels that the Wings did some good things early, but they were picked apart, the Thrashers scored on their opportunities, and they got away from their good habits. He says that the Wings are a proud group that's determined and tries to play well defensively and play hard, but it wasn't their night tonight, the Thrashers scored on their opportunities and the Wings didn't. He says that he wasn't happy with Osgood's play, he would have finished if Babcock was happy, and he's always concerned about these losing streaks as the Wings were able to pepper the Wild on Friday as well but weren't good defensively, and it shows you that you can score all you want, but you still need to be good defensively, the Wings were plain old beat and outplayed in Ottawa, and Tuedsay's game was a repeat of the Wild game.

wednesday,"The Coyotes will hand out their annual team awards before Friday's home finale against the Colorado Avalanche. The team doesn't recognize the most improved player but if it did, defenseman Michael Stone would seem the obvious choice for that honor. Stone didn't crack the top six to start the season, shuffling between the Coyotes and the American Hockey League until he stuck around with the big club after a recall Feb.22. Since then, he's become a reliable option on the third pairing with a big shot from the right side. The 22-year-old, taken 69th overall in 2008, made his Coyotes debut last season, playing in 13 games and two playoff games, but this season has been a turning point in his career.

Then after a Pamesa turnover, Greer scored an easy layup to give Slask the lead, 83-82, with less than a minute to play. But Rigaudeau scored a two-meter jumper off the board, Oberto had a key steal, feeding Kammerichs for a fast break dunk and that quickly, Pamesa was ahead again, 83-86, with 30 seconds to play. Greer was fouled to avoid a three-pointer, hitting both free throws to make it 85-86. Three non-shooting fouls followed, until Rigaudeau finally went to the line with 5.8 seconds on the clock. He hit both shots, forcing Greer to look for a three-pointer in hopes of tying, but he lost the ball and Pamesa was the only team to walk off the court undefeated still. Wednesday"""

wednesday,"Palmetto, the American species of palm, is found in California and Florida, often growing to the height of 50 feet and having leaves 5 feet long. The most important is the cabbage palmetto. Other kinds of this species grow in the Bermudas, along the Mediterranean shores and in Arabia. The characteristics are the same as those of the palm, only that they are not so tall. Palm Sunday, the Sunday before Easter, takes its name from the usage of blessing branches of the palm, or of other substituted trees, and carrying them in the procession in memory of the triumphal entry of Christ into Jerusalem. The custom can be traced back to the 8th century. In the Roman Catholic Church the priest blesses the branches and hands them to the worshipers as they pass out, and when the hymn, ""All glory praise and honor"" is sung by the choir and the congregation outside, the doors are opened and the people return. The branches are taken home and burned and the ashes used on Ashe Wednesday"

wednesday,"A Sneak Attack? Why is it that some calendars have been modified to reflect Sunday as the seventh day of the weekly cycle? As mentioned earlier, it is impossible to prove that Sunday is the day to be kept sacred from the Bible. In fact, the Catholic Church has in the past offered a $5,000 reward to anyone who could prove that the Sabbath was changed to Sunday. This reward has never been collected. Therefore, in order to minimize questions that might be asked regarding the keeping of Sunday instead of Saturday as the seventh day, some have deemed it appropriate to change the calendar to reflect Sunday as the seventh day.

On April 29, 1992 a jury acquitted four Los Angeles Police Department officers accused in the videotaped beating of African-American motorist Rodney King. The outrage that followed is now called the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. I was born in Pasadena, California and my youth was spent in and around the suburbs of Los Angeles. Los Angeles was my stomping grounds and I loved the city. At the time of the Rodney King trials I had been working weekly for the Los Angeles Times and that trial was definitely heating things up. The weekend after the acquittal the city was ready to blow and so many of us were outraged with the acquittal. I took off that weekend to San Francisco right when it blew. On Monday morning I checked my answering machine and I had gotten a call from Nancy Duckworth explaining that the Los Angeles Times Magazine was hiring 9 LA artists to depict their personal feelings and art in response to the verdict and the riots and that the artist, could do anything, no sketches just make sure that the art gets in by Thursday"

thursday,"The same can't be said for the Tampa Bay Rays -- the hottest team in baseball.One day after their chances for the AL East title took a major hit, the Orioles continue their push for the top wild-card spot Tuesday night against the recently eliminated Rays.Baltimore (92-68) officially clinched a wild-card berth Sunday but entered this three-game series with its sights set on its first division crown since 1997. However, a 5-3 loss Monday coupled with the Yankees' 10-2 rout of Boston made that goal much more difficult as it fell one game behind New York with two to play.""We didn't take care of our business,"" center fielder Adam Jones said. ""We lost. When it comes to the Yankees, we can't control them. We can't control if they win or lose.""Matt Wieters hit a solo homer and Chris Davis continued his power surge with a two-run shot in the ninth, but the Orioles had their four-game win streak snapped. They dropped into a tie with Oakland for the top wild card, which would include home-field advantage for that one-game playoff.Although the Rays (89-71) staved off elimination for a few hours with their 11th win in 12 games, they were ousted from contention when the Athletics beat Texas.""Honestly, it just is what it is,"" Rays manager Joe Maddon said. ""We had opportunities early in the year to win more games, and we did not. But so did everybody else.""Maddon said he's thought about lineup changes for the final two games now that his team has been eliminated.Third baseman Evan Longoria, still dealing with a partially torn left hamstring, may have played his final game of the year.""I've thought about talking to certain guys that are banged up,"" he told the team's official website. ""That's my only thought.""Davis has homered in a career-best five straight games, with six total and 12 RBIs during that span. He's 3 for 9 with one home run against scheduled starter James Shields.The last player to homer in six consecutive games was Rays first baseman Carlos Pena from June 6-12, 2010, and the last Orioles player to do it was Reggie Jackson in 1976.Miguel Gonzalez (8-4, 3.45 ERA) wouldn't mind if Davis matches Jackson as he tries to win three consecutive starts for the first time.The rookie right-hander was sharp again Wednesday in a 12-2 victory over Toronto, allowing two runs and five hits over seven innings. He is 2-0 with a 2.79 ERA in his past three starts and has completed at least six innings in five straight outings.After struggling in his first start this season against the Rays, Gonzalez has a 1.38 ERA in the past two meetings without recording a decision.With the playoffs no longer an option, Shields (15-9, 3.62) can focus on matching his career high in wins set last season.Despite walking four and hitting two batters, the right-hander was able to limit the damage against the White Sox on Thursday"

The SAO is meeting with the presi¬ dents' council (a panel of the presidents of UTSA's registered student organiza¬ tions) to gain input on the proposed policy. According to Hank Phelps, director of the University Center and student activities, students on the president's council want to enforce rules governing posting. Currently, enforcement rests with die SAO. One means of enforce¬ ment involves denying posting rights to those students or groups who do not remove posters within 48 hours afler the end of Ihe advertised event. The current limit is 24 hours. The proposed policy prohibits the posting of ""obscene"" maierial, lo be determined by the SAO. The proposed policy stales that authorization of post¬ ing will not be granted for anydiing dial SAO believes to be offensive to the students or the community."" Also prohibited, according to a draft of the proposal, are materials that ""glo¬ rify, edify or support the misuse and/or abuse of alcohol."" This is a Board of Regents rule and applies to the whole . University of TcxasSystem. According to Phelps diis is equivalent to the prohi¬ bition of any reference to alcohol. Some bulletin boards are a.ssigned lo organizations for their use. A lottery system has been proposed as the means of assigning the limited numbcrof boards to the interested groups. ""It can be incredibly competitive for some organizations, ""Phelps .said. ""They want a board, and they want it in a particular location."" The SAO plans to consider the number of students in each of the applicant organizations and the potential number of students thai will benefit from llic group's inronnaiion. Some ofthe bulletin boards will be di¬ vided into .sections and shored among groups. The SAO and ihc presidents' council should come lo an agreement and final¬ ize the policy wiihin a nionih. All regis¬ tered student organizations will he .sent copiesof thcproposcdpolicy. The SAO hopes to have the new policy imple¬ mented by January 1, 1992. internsiiip opportunities on the rise for Engiish majors Davies speaks about third Russian Revolution By James Sanchez Contributing Writer The recent coup attempt against Mikhail Gorbachev and its subsequent failure was die subject of a lecture pre¬ sented last week by Dr. Brian Davies. Davies, assistant professor of history at UTSA, discussed the immediate and long-term effects of the reactionary in¬ solence and what the future holds for Gorbachev and Russian Republic Presi¬ dent Boris Yeltsin. The hu-gcsl and most obvious effect was die end of seven decades of Com¬ munist rule. According to Davies, coup plotters diought that il would be a popu¬ lar revolt because of the depressed stale ofthe Soviet economy and Gorbachev's inability lo deliver on promised eco¬ nomic reforms. The coup only acceler¬ ated the dismantling of Communism because of the citizens' resistance to a regression into a prc-Glastnost state, Davies said. The leader of the reformers, Yeltsin, made a great name for himself wilh the people by calling for civil disobedience during die Soviet slate of emergency. Davies pointed out how little is known about Yeltsin. Whedier he is a true re¬ former or a self-serving politician re¬ mains lo be seen. Davies feels that Gorbachev's prc-coup unpopularity grew wor.se when he did not ideiuify himself with ilic reformers, leaving the future of his presidency an enigma as well. Whatever the outcome of the Soviet Union's political lurnioil, Davis feels, a more pressing issue is weighing heavily on the minds of its eiiizcns.

""In the past we tended lo have more placements on campus, which is good, but mosl students prefer to go off cam¬ pus so they can begin to develop con¬ tacts,"" Reesman said. In Reesman's view, internships are the best way to break into die working world. ""Employers don't care if you were the president of die German club, or if you were active in student politics, as much as diey care whether you've had experience,"" she said. Usually about two students a semes¬ ter arc offered jobs at the firms where they fulfilled their internship. Allen Green, an English major widi an emphasis in technical writing, is in¬ terning at the ""San Antonio Business Journal"" as an in-housc writer.

thursday,"• An officer in a marked patrol vehicle traveling on Third Street observed an SUV driving down the middle of the street. The SUV made a very slow and wide turn onto another street without using a turn signal. The officer followed the vehicle, as it made another slow, wide turn. The officer activated his overhead emergency lights, and the SUV pulled into a driveway at a residence and came to a stop. The male driver could not provide a driver’s license, and told the officer that he didn’t have one, that it was revoked. The officer could smell the strong odor of alcohol coming from the driver’s breath and he exhibited other physical signs of intoxication. The car was registered to someone else and the driver said that he lived at the residence he was parked at.

But my Gram loved it and, in fact, one year had a fit because she lost the neck during the rinsing/stuffing/trussing/roasting process. It was one of the few times she let people into her kitchen as she cooked--my dad helped her dig through the trash until they finally uncovered it.

He built for him a beautiful convent in the park of Plessis, in a place called Montils: and another at Amboise, and upon the very spot where he met him when he was dauphin: and going to Rome in 1495, where he made a triumphant entry, and was saluted Emperor of Constantinople by Pope Alexander VI., he built there, on Mount Pincio, a stately monastery for this Order, under the name of the Blessed Trinity, in which none but Frenchmen can be admitted. In his reign the saint founded the convent of Nigeon, near Paris, on which occasion two doctors, who had violently opposed the institute before the bishop of Paris, were so moved by the sight of the saint at Plessis, that they entered his Order in 1506. Pope Julius II. again approved the rule, in which the saint had made some alterations. King Charles VIII. dying in 1498, Lewis XII. succeeded him. He at first gave the saint leave to return to Italy; but quickly recalled it, and heaped honours and benefactions on all his relations. St. Francis spent the three last months of his life within his cell, to prepare himself for a happy death, denying himself all communication with mankind, that nothing might divert his thoughts from death and eternity. He fell sick of a fever on Palm-Sunday, in 1506. On Maundy-Thursday"

In liturgical literature the name ""Septuagesima"" occurs for the first time in the Gelasian Sacramentary. Why the day (or the week, or the period) has the name Septuagesima, and the next Sunday Sexagesima, etc., is a matter of dispute among writers. It is certainly not the seventieth day before Easter, still less is the next Sunday the sixtieth, fiftieth, etc. Amularius, ""De eccl. Off."", I, I, would make the Septuagesima mystically represent the Babylonian Captivity of seventy years, would have it begin with this Sunday on which the Sacramentaries and Antiphonaries give the Introit ""Circumdederunt me undique"" and end with the Saturday after Easter, when the Church sings ""Eduxit Dominus populum suum.""

After a brief stop at his own home, where he picked up some personal belongings, Sickles and a crew of prominent friends, including the mayor of Washington, James Berret, rode to the city jail. There he stoutly declined bail, declaring that his only wish was a swift trial. If the Congressman suspected his incarceration would not hurt his cause, he was right. His transfer to the warden’s quarters after four days of fighting bedbugs in the jail was ignored by the public, who seized upon Sickles as a heroic defender of family honor. (The prisoner did himself no harm by asking for, and getting, a visit with his five-year-old daughter, Laura, and later calling for the company of his pet greyhound, Dandy.)

His strong friendship with the President dated from his service as secretary of legation during Buchanan’s ambassadorship to the Court of St. James’s. In addition, Sickles had in his three years in Washington won a significant niche in the upper reaches of capital society. His ample house, known as the Stockton mansion, shared Lafayette Park with the handsome residences of the Adamses, the Taylors, the Blairs, the Slidells. This elite, plus scores of other Cabinet and congressional notables, had flocked to Sickles’ Thursday"

friday,"Middlesbrough 0 Plymouth Argyle 1 HIS first match in charge of Celtic ended in a 5-0 hammering, but the season still ended in title celebrations at Parkhead. It is little wonder then that Gordon Strachan is not too concerned after opening a new chapter of his career with another defeat. Had Gareth Southgate survived this long he would have been fearing the sack this morning after another day of the sort of home woe at the Riverside Stadium which ultimately cost him his job. But in Strachan, chairman Steve Gibsons choice to succeed Southgate, the majority of fans are satisfied with the appointment and optimistic the little Scotsman with a dry sense of humour can put the smiles back on their faces. Match one of his reign might have ended in a narrow loss courtesy of Jamie Mackies 64th minute winner, it might also have ended with Middlesbrough dropping below the Championships play-off zone in front of a crowd that rose above 21,000 again. But he needs to be given time to address the failings of the previous regime, having inherited a squad short on confidence on Teesside turf and one Strachan has already highlighted lacks the type of experience he would prefer. The fans will be more patient now, said Julio Arca, recalled to the starting line-up by his new manager, albeit in a less familiar role on the right. We lost and it was disappointing but the fans will give him time. He has only been here a week. They will have to be patient and give him time. They appreciate it takes time for a manager to put his stamp on things. He needs time to show what he can do with the players and see what they can do for him. Everyone needs time. We need time to get used to him and he will need time to get used to us. This week has been good because we have trained all week with him, we know what he is looking for. Hopefully things will work out. He wants to improve players, make them play better to get promotion. Strachan seemed relaxed beforehand, as he signed autographs from the dug-out and waved to every corner of the ground following his belated entrance out of the tunnel. By full-time he had every right to feel more aggrieved. Perhaps he might approach things differently if a similar result and performance is being repeated a few weeks into his tenure. But after his first match in charge he was complimentary towards his players rather than critical. He has been very calm with us, said Arca, with Boro three points short of second place and just as many above 12th in the Championship. The manager showed how much experience he has, he has been in the game for a long time. He told us what he wants us to do. At the end he was as disappointed as us, but he said we deserved to win the game. We have not seen the angry side of him yet. We know how he can be, if performances are really bad we will see the other side of him. But this time the lads performed really hard, we just didnt score, there was not too much wrong. Plymouth had started the day second from bottom and without a clean sheet all season, meaning expectations were high around the Riverside, with most expecting Strachan to open in perfect fashion. It soon became clear that was not going to be the case. Plymouth, who went close in the opening half when winger Alan Judge struck inches wide and goalkeeper Brad Jones denied Karl Duguid with a save low to his right, never looked like conceding. On the one occasion Middlesbrough broke them down, centre- back Shane Lowry made an exceptional block on six yards from Marvin Emnes after Adam Johnsons burst into the box from the left. With options limited, Strachan could not change things too much, but he did try to find more creativity by including Arca on the right flank. He also brought on Marcus Bent for his first piece of action since his two-month loan from Birmingham. Neither decision really paid off. Arca performed well after being asked to tuck in and support the forwards, but the tactic still failed to improve the tally of seven goals from the first eight matches at the Riverside. Everyone has been excited to be working with him and training really hard to be in the team. We didnt know the team until late on Friday"

With defenseman and leading scorer Tobias Enstrom also injured, captain Andrew Ladd has carried the majority of the offensive load for Winnipeg, scoring four of the team's last eight goals.The Sabres, with one win in their last four games, are coming off a 4-3 home loss to Pittsburgh on Sunday. Leading scorer Thomas Vanek had a goal and an assist - his first points in four games. Captain Jason Pominville hasn't registered a point in six games after producing 14 in the first 10. Buffalo's slumping offense is bad news for goaltender Ryan Miller, who is hitting his stride, limiting opponents to two goals in four of his last five starts. Cody Hodgson is the only member of the Sabres top line still scoring with any consistency. Hodgson has a goal in each of his last two games four points in his last five.TV: 7 p.m. ET, TSN Jets, MSG BuffaloABOUT THE JETS (5-8-1): Ladd leads the team with seven goals.

Without even further reductions in this already low rate, there is little in the economic picture to drive spending. Household net worth is down. Real wages and disposable income less transfer payments are not growing. Employee hiring is still tepid.

friday,"These three canticles are sometimes referred to as the ""evangelical canticles"", as they are taken from the Gospel of St Luke. They are sung every day (unlike those from the Old Testament which, as is, shown above, are only of weekly occurrence). They are placed not amongst the psalms (as are the seven from the Old Testament), but separated from them by the Chapter, the Hymn, the Versicle and Response, and thus come immediately before the Prayer (or before the preces, if these are to be said). They are thus given an importance and distinction elevating them into great prominence, which is further heightened by the rubric which requires the singers and congregations to stand while they are being sung (in honour of the mystery of the Incarnation, to which they refer). Further, while the ""Magnificat"" is being sung at Solemn Vespers, the altar is incensed as at Solemn Mass. All three canticles are in use in the Greek and Anglican churches. In the Breviary the above-named ten canticles are provided with antiphons and are sung in the same eight psalm-tones and in the same alternating manner as the psalms. To make the seven taken from the Old Testament suitable for this manner of singing, nos. 2-7 sometimes divide a verse of the Bible into two verses, thus increasing the number of Breviary verses. No. 1, however, goes much farther than this. It uses only a portion of the long canticle in Daniel, and condenses, expands, omits, and interverts verses and portions of verses. In the Breviary the canticle begins with verse 57, and ends with verse 56 (Dan., iii); and the penultimate verse is clearly an interpolation, ""Benedicamus Patrem, et Filium . . ."". In addition to their Breviary use some of the canticles are used in other connections in the liturgy; e.g. the ""Nunc dimittis"" as a tract at the Mass of the Feast of the Purification (when 2 February comes after Septuagesima); the ""Benedictus"" in the burial of the dead and in various processions. The use of the ""Benedictus"" and the ""Benedicite"" at the old Gallican Mass is interestingly described by Duchene (Christian Worship: Its Origin and Evolution, London, 1903, 191-196). In the Office of the Greek Church the canticles numbered 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are used at Lauds, but are not assigned to the same days as in the Roman Breviary. Two others (Isaiah 26:9-20, and Jonah 2:2-9) are added for Friday"

When I finally thought I was going mad I checked myself into 28 day rehab. I stayed sober for 12 years. During that time I met my wifee and we had 4 wonderful children. Life was great. Then, as a corp. executive, I went through a merger and received a lump of cash. I decided to write what turned out to be an award winning historical novel. While doings so, I started drinking again for some reason. Slowly at first, but more and more over a few years. I re-entered the business world and hated it. The drinking got worse, but I only did it after the kids were in bed, though I am sure they noticed changes in me. The company I worked for went bankrupt and now I am in a new position that is stressful and boring. 2 months ago deep depression and anxiety re-emerged for the first time in 20 years.

I have come to the reluctant conclusion that it is, in fact, my frantic attempt to stick to something resembling a monthly schedule that has actually caused a recent series of disasters around here. It started a few years ago when I took a break from formatting this site to go downstairs and install a window air conditioner and was promptly struck by lightning. Then, just a few weeks ago, I was sitting on the couch in my office, again working on this site, when a sudden windstorm knocked half a large tree into the side of the house, missing the window behind me by about six inches. In late May I took a break from finalizing this issue to mow the lawn, and the mowing deck on the tractor went kafloozie, necessitating my spending several days on my face in the driveway trying to fix the damn thing, which isn’t fun when you have only limited use of your left arm and you really need said left arm to pull an idler pulley against a big spring so you can get the goddamn drive belt back on the deck. I ended up wrapping a steel cable around the pulley and getting Kathy to stand ten feet away and pull on it real hard. That was a separate ordeal, incidentally, from the day I spent unwinding the steel cable from the blades last month. Then the guy from DirecTV showed up to replace the satellite dish and turned out to be a major jerk who glared at us silently while he bent our brand-new gutters.

Permission to distribute this document in printed form must be obtained in writing. 1.2 Introduction The original version of this paper was written as a final year undergraduate dissertation in the Department of German Studies at the University of Birmingham (UK). It is my intention to try to keep this work updated, although I cannot guarantee that updates will be regularly published. The format of the first half of this paper is principally chronological, detailing important events, such as the founding of individual extremist parties and subsequent government legislation aimed at curbing their activities. The second half of the paper concentrates on the present-day scene in Germany, with particular reference to the reasons behind the popularity of the right-wing extremists and certain parties, the radical right-wingers and skinheads and the reaction of the Government and the public. 2.0 CHRONOLOGY In 1973, the founder of the neo-Nazi group Bauern- und Buergerinitiative, Thies Christophersen, published a text entitled Die Auschwitz-Luege (The Auschwitz Lie), one of many such revisionist articles to appear in the 1970s and 1980s, culminating in the infamous Leuchter Report. Also in this year, Joachim Floth founded his Deutsch-Voelkische Gemeinschaft (DVG). 1974 saw the arrival of three new right-wing organisations: the Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann (WSG), the Deutsche Sozialistische Volkspartei and the Unabhaengiger Schuelerverbund. In September of the same year, the Rechtsblock fuer Arbeiter, Bauern und Soldaten was also formed, whilst in November, Gary Rex Lauck, an American revisionist, was arrested and expelled for extolling the virtues of National Socialism. In March 1975, the Bund Freies Deutschland won 3.4% of the votes in the elections for the Berliner Abgeordnetenhaus. In April of the same year, the Kampfbund Deutscher Soldaten (KDS) was formed in Frankfurt am Main. Its main policy was one of Holocaust denial, possibly sparked off by Christophersen's Die Auschwitz-Luege and similar publications. In October, the Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands(NPD) was deemed to be an extremist party and to have unconstitutional aims. Proof that banning one party did not prevent the extremists is demonstrated by the fact that in December, Manfred Ohl a former NPD official founded the Nationalrevolutionaerer Bund (NRB). In March 1976 Gary Rex Lauck entered Germany with a false passport and was subsequently arrested in Mainz, before being given a four year jail sentence and fine in July, for spreading Nazi propaganda. He was later expelled from Germany, although he was allowed to return in 1979 to testify at the trial of a neo-Nazi. May 1977 saw Michael Kuehnen, a former lieutenant in the German army, form the SA-Sturm-Hamburg. This marked the start of Kuehnen's career as a neo-Nazi leader. In November he was to found the Aktionsfront Nationaler Sozialisten. In September the Bund Deutscher Maedel (BDM) was formed in Hamburg to follow the ideals laid down by its Nazi namesake. It was in this year that the former Chancellor Willy Brandt called for a crackdown on neo-Nazi activities. Consequently all states were required to submit a report on extremist activity in their regions. In March 1978, the leader of the Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann was sentenced to imprisonment and fined for assembling an arms cache. In 1978 and 1979 the Government banned, or prevented the distribution to minors, of over 50 neo-Nazi publications. On March 17th 1979, the Freiheitliche Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (FAP) was founded by Martin Pappe, an unemployed salesman and teacher. During the summer of this year, the Hilfsorganisation fuer nationale politische Gefangene und deren Angehoerige e.V. (HNG) was founded. This was an umbrella group which aimed to provide mainly financial support for neo-Nazis. Considering the benefactors of the work of this organisation, it is quite surprising that it managed to achieve the status of a registered charity. In September, Michael Kuehnen was arrested for inciting racist attacks and was given a four year sentence, during which he wrote Die Zweite Revolution. Glaube und Kampf (The Second revolution. Belief and Battle), extolling the virtues of a Fourth Reich. His sentence was extended by eight months in April 1992, for sending a copy of this book to Thies Christophersen for publishing.<1> In early December Gerhard Frey founded the Volksbewegung fuer Generalamnestie (VOGA). In 1979 and 1980 a Hollywood television series, entitled Holocaust, was screened throughout Western Europe, including Germany. A survey conducted by a West German television company found that 41% of Germans with televisions saw the final episode of the series, and whilst 75% of these were born after Hitler's rise to power in 1933, and so would have been 12 years old at the end of the war, possibly too young to remember the events in any great detail. The survey also found that 81% of those who watched the final episode discussed it with others and that 65% admitted to being ""deeply moved"" by it.<2> The series was attacked by the NPD's newspaper, the Deutsche Stimme, and the Deutsche National-Zeitung, the newspaper of the DVU, as being Hollywood propaganda, and led to an increase in neo-Nazi activity throughout Germany. In January 1980 Gerhart Baum, the Interior Minister, banned the Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann for being anti-constitutional because of its appeal to the young, although in March, Karl-Heinz Hoffmann took his objections to the Administrative Courtin Berlin, which dismissed the complaint on December 2nd. On September 28th at the Oktoberfest in Munich, a 24lb bomb placed near the entrance, killed 12 people, including the bomber, and injured 312. A neo-Nazi group, initially suspected to be the Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann, claimed responsibility, although it was later discovered that the bomber had left the paramilitary group prior to the attack. On the 24th March 1981, a series of raids on numerous apartments across the Federal Republic, led to the confiscation of a large amount of Canadian and American anti-Semitic material. Wilkinson states that nearly 1,000 homes were raided, although Angelika Koenigseder quotes a figure of about 450.<3> Gary Lauck and Ernst Zuendel, a German Revisionist living in Canada, were subsequently arrested and charged with the smuggling and distribution of banned neo-Nazi propaganda. In April tough new laws were introduced, banning the distribution of anti-Semitic propaganda, including Hitler's autobiography Mein Kampf. On October 24th, 156kg of explosives, 13,520 rounds of ammunition and 1kg of the highly toxic potassium cyanide were found on Lueneburg Heath. In November, Franz Schoenhuber published his book, Ich war dabei (I Was There), celebrating his days in the Waffen-SS. This led to him leaving the CSU, although the right-wing Deutsche National-Zeitung pronounced it to be the ""book of the year"". In its 1981 report, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution declared that crime caused by the right extremists was at its highest level since the end of the Second World War, having recorded 1,824 incidents, an increase of 11% on the previous year. Wilkinson states that: ""Two thirds of these were directly linked to the neo-Nazi groups, and over 300 were anti-Semitic.""<4> In January 1982, the Interior Minister, Gerhart Baum, banned the Volkssozialistische Bewegung Deutschlands/Partei der Arbeit (VSBD/PdA), led by Friedhelm Busse, and the Junge Front (JF). In February the Freundeskreis Ulrich Hutten was founded, whilst in March, Friedrich Ring founded the Deutscher Buergerschutz (DBS) in response to growing crime and an increase in the influx of foreigners. In April the Hamburger Liste fuer Auslaenderstopp was formed. January 1983 saw the merger of the Aktionsfront Nationaler Sozialisten with the Nationale Aktivisten (NA), forming the ANS/NA. On April 1st the Deutsche Freiheitsbewegung (DDF) was formed. In November, former CSU-Bundestagsabgeordnete Franz Handlos and Ekkehard Voigt formed die Republikaner with Franz Schoenhuber. On December 7th, the Interior Minister banned the Aktionsfront Nationaler Sozialisten/Nationale Aktivisten and affiliated organisations. Also in this year, Friedhelm Busse was sentenced to three years and nine months imprisonment for numerous offences involving the possession of firearms. On 28th April 1984, the Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands (NPD) in North Rhein-Westphalia first used skinheads for security at its regional party conference. Vehicles were damaged and political opponents injured. In April, Michael Kuehnen founded the ANS-Auslandsorganisation (ANS-AO), as a precursor to a pan-European extremist movement. On May 26th the Komitee zur Vorbereitung der Feierlichkeiten des 100. Geburtstages von Adolf Hitler (KAH) (Committee for the Preparations for the Celebrations of the 100th Birthday of Adolf Hitler) was formed. At its conference in November, the NPD rejected a motion calling for the party to distance itself from the skinhead movement. In January 1985, the FAP and the Wiking-Jugend formed an umbrella organisation for nationalist groups: the Volkstreue ausserparlamentarische Opposition (VAPO). In March, Voigt and Handlos left the Republikaner and set up the Bayerische Republikaner and the Freiheitliche Volkspartei (FVP) respectively. Also in March, the Soziale Volkspartei was formed in Berlin. At the Erste Europaeische Fuehrerthing in Paris on September 1st, many right-wing organisations decide to coordinate their activities on a European level. In November, two further organisations were formed: the Nationalistische Front (NF) and the Deutsche Aktionspartei/Bewegung der totalen Ordnung (DAP). In September 1986, the Gemeinschaft Eisernes Kreuz EK1 was formed by former members of the FAP, whilst on October 12th, the Republikaner won 3% of the vote in the Bavarian regional elections. In November, Gerhard Frey of the Deutsche Volksunion (DVU), founded the Deutsche Volksliste. On March 11th 1987, the former NPD official Guenter Deckert founded Die Deutschen, whilst on April 17th the Koenigstreue Deutsche Volkspartei (KDVP) was formed. In late August, neo-Nazis demonstrated in Wunsiedel, awaiting the funeral of Rudolf Hess. In September, two more extremist organisations were formed: namely the Arbeitskreis Junge Familie and the Sturmvogel - Deutscher Jugendbund. In January 1988, the Deutsch-Nationale Volkspartei (DNVP) was formed. On 5th April, Fred A. Leuchter published the Leuchter Report in the USA. As an engineer and self-pronounced gas chamber expert, he claimed that the mass killings of the Jews in the so-called ""extermination camps"" could not have taken place. This served to strengthen the beliefs of right-wing extremists, neo-Nazis and Revisionists, that there was no mass-extermination of the Jews under the Third Reich. The Auto- und Buergerpartei (ABD) was founded in September, followed by Die Demokraten in November. On January 2nd 1989, during the campaign for the elections for the Berlin House of Representatives, the Republikaner showed a television advertisement of Turkish children and, in the background, music from the film Spiel mir das Lied vom Tod (Play Me The Song of Death). In the elections later that month, the Republikaner won 7.5% of the votes. However, in June, they won 7.1% of the votes (i.e. two million votes) in the European elections, with a result of 14.6% in Bavaria. In May of that year, the Munich court ordered the withdrawal of a computer diskette containing a program entitled Arier-Test (Aryan Test). In July 1990, former FAP activists formed the Nationale Offensive (NO). After the banning of the Internationaler Revisionistenkongress / Leuchter-Kongress in Munich in March 1991 and the arrest of its organiser Ernst Zuendel, 400 delegates protested in the city. On 25th April Michael Kuehnen, ""outed"" as a homosexual during his three year incarceration between 1985 and 1988, died from an AIDS-related illness. From 17th to 22nd September radical right-wing skinheads rioted outside a residence for foreigners in Hoyerswerda (Saxony) injuring 30 people. This protest triggered numerous other attacks throughout the country in the following weeks, injuring over 100 people. Indeed, during the weekend of the 28th-29th September, police recorded 43 attacks on foreigners, 22 of which were in North Rhein-Westphalia. On the 3rd October, two Lebanese children were critically injured in a fire-bomb attack on a refuge in Huenxe in North Rhein-Westphalia. On the 13th October, a refuge in Immenstadt (Allgaeu) was destroyed by a fire-bomb, seriously injuring two Kurds. On March 14th 1992, a Skinhead concert was held near Weimar, with German groups such as Radikahl and Kraftschlag playing alongside American groups such as Bound for Glory. On April 5th the Republikaner won 10.9% of the votes in the regional elections in Badem-Wuerttemberg, whilst in a Berlin district election in May the party won 8.3% of the votes cast. In July, the Foerderwerk Mitteldeutsche Jugend (FMJ) was founded. From August 22nd to 28th there was heavy rioting outside a home for asylum seekers in Rostock-Lichtenhagen, culminating in an arson attack on the home on the 25th. Between August 29th and September 2nd, there was major rioting outside an asylum seekers refuge in Cottbus. On November 23rd one Turkish woman and two Turkish children were killed and nine others injured when neo-Nazis set fire to their refuge in Moelln (Schleswig-Holstein). Four days later the Nationalsozialistische Front (NF) was banned, as was the Deutsche Alternative on December 10th, the Deutscher Kameradschaftsbund (DKB) on the 21st and the Nationale Offensive on the 22nd. The events at Rostock and Cottbus marked the start of a new wave of violence throughout Germany: from September to December 4167 racially motivated incidents were recorded, both the violent and the non-violent, compared with 2169 incidents in the period from January to August.<5> On May 29th 1993, an arson attack on a house in Solingen killed five Turkish women and a girl, sparking off a new surge of extremist violence against foreigners throughout Germany. On August 27th Brandenburg became the first state to ban the use of the Reichskriegsflagge, a symbol used by the neo-Nazis to stir up hatred against foreigners. This move was followed only days later by a similar ban in other states. Joerg Petritsch, a singer with the skinhead group Stoerkraft, was given a two-year suspended sentence for spreading Nazi-propaganda. On October 29th, Cologne police arrested Fred A. Leuchter and charged him with Holocaust denial. On April 14th 1994, when Manfred Kanther, the Interior Minister, published the 1993 Report of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, he stated that he had no intention of banning either the Republikaner or the Deutsche Volksunion (DVU), for fear of driving their 23,000 members underground. Instead, he said, the parties would continue to be carefully monitored by the police. On May 14th, neo-Nazis terrorised foreigners in Magdeburg by shouting ""Deutschland den Deutschen"" (""Germany for the Germans"") and chasing African students into a cafi before beating them with iron bars. On the 17th January 1995, the trial of three men and one woman began in Gross-Gerau. The four are charged with publishing the neo-Nazi booklet Der Einblick in 1993, containing the names and addresses of about 200 political opponents. Despite being withdrawn, some 180 copies are estimated to remain in circulation. The Dignity Report from February 15th 1994 said the following of the publication: ""On the pages of Der Einblick, the top leadership in German neo-Nazi networks issues a call to ""neutralize all anti-German, anti-nationalist forces"" and urge followers to ""stop squandering the enormous violent potential"" of the racist movement and to ""mount successful counter actions."" The publication contains information on intelligence gathering techniques and urges neo-Nazis to cultivate relations with police so that ""data can be gathered without danger to oneself."""" On the 18th January, the Office for the Protection reported that the 1994 figures for right-wing offences in Berlin had risen from 650 in 1993 to 750. On 24th February, the Government eventually banned the FAP, described by Manfred Kanther, Interior Minister, as: ""an anti-democratic group ""which disdains human rights and stirs up xenophobia and racism.""""<6> Similarly, in Hamburg, homes of members of the Nationale Liste were raided. On April 20th scores of neo-Nazis were arrested around Germany for rioting to mark Hitler's birthday. In the same week Guenter Deckert, the leader of the NPD, was sentenced to two years' imprisonment by a court in Karlsruhe for Holocaust denial and incitement to racial hatred. On March 23rd, Hamburg police raided the homes of those who had ordered and received neo-Nazi propaganda from the NSDAP-AO. Almost simultaneously Gerhard (Gary) Lauck was arrested by Danish police in Copenhagen. After much legal wrangling, the Danish Supreme Court confirmed on Friday"

He was also helpful in making suggestions for the meal, and his choices were right on. Also tried the beignets for dessert, which was an excellent cap for the meal.

friday,"This morning I lay long abed, and then to my office, where I read all the morning my Spanish book of Rome. At noon I walked in the Hall, where I heard the news of a letter from Monk, who was now gone into the City again, and did resolve to stand for the sudden filling up of the House, and it was very strange how the countenance of men in the Hall was all changed with joy in half an hour’s time. So I went up to the lobby, where I saw the Speaker reading of the letter; and after it was read, Sir A. Haselrigge came out very angry, and Billing1 standing at the door, took him by the arm, and cried, “Thou man, will thy beast carry thee no longer? thou must fall!” The House presently after rose, and appointed to meet again at three o’clock. I went then down into the Hall, where I met with Mr. Chetwind, who had not dined no more than myself, and so we went toward London, in our way calling at two or three shops, but could have no dinner. At last, within Temple Bar, we found a pullet ready roasted, and there we dined. After that he went to his office in Chancery Lane, calling at the Rolls, where I saw the lawyers pleading. Then to his office, where I sat in his study singing, while he was with his man (Mr. Powell’s son) looking after his business. Thence we took coach for the City to Guildhall, where the Hall was full of people expecting Monk and Lord Mayor to come thither, and all very joyfull. Here we stayed a great while, and at last meeting with a friend of his we went to the 3 Tun tavern and drank half a pint of wine, and not liking the wine we went to an alehouse, where we met with company of this third man’s acquaintance, and there we drank a little. Hence I went alone to Guildhall to see whether Monk was come again or no, and met with him coming out of the chamber where he had been with the Mayor and Aldermen, but such a shout I never heard in all my life, crying out, “God bless your Excellence.” Here I met with Mr. Lock, and took him to an alehouse, and left him there to fetch Chetwind; when we were come together, Lock told us the substance of the letter that went from Monk to the Parliament; wherein, after complaints that he and his officers were put upon such offices against the City as they could not do with any content or honour, that there are many members now in the House that were of the late tyrannical Committee of Safety. That Lambert and Vane are now in town, contrary to the vote of Parliament. That there were many in the House that do press for new oaths to be put upon men; whereas we have more cause to be sorry for the many oaths that we have already taken and broken. That the late petition of the fanatique people presented by Barebone, for the imposing of an oath upon all sorts of people, was received by the House with thanks. That therefore he [Monk] do desire that all writs for filling up of the House be issued by Friday"

Reading opened the game with threes from Brittany Marquart and Jami Hubbard to take a 6-0 lead, and pushed it to a 7-2 lead.The game came down to the third quarter, as Reading outscored Quincy 11-4 going into the final stanza. Quincy did not give up, getting within eight points midway through the fourth, but Reading was able to close out with a three-point play by Ashley McCarley to make it a 40-31 game. Every time Quincy attempted to respond, Reading was able to answer the call on the defensive end.""Our effort was good, very good,"" said Reading coach Ryan Mulnix. ""We seem to come through when it matters. We made some outside shots and took care of the ball when we needed to.""Reading’s early momentum was stopped by a technical foul on Mulnix, which proved to be a costly, as Sarah Ward hit both free throws for Quincy and Katie Santi drained a three to tie the game at 7-7. Reading was able to go back up by three at 10-7 and Ward hit a basket for Quincy to cut the deficit to 10-9 after the opening quarter.The close game continued into the second quarter, as Quincy took an 11-10 lead with a jumper from Ashton King. Marquart tripled again for Reading to make it a 13-11 game and King tied the game up with another jumper. The Rangers went on a small run with five straight points from Hubbard to make it 18-13. Reading pushed the lead to 21-15 and Quincy cut it down with a bucket from Ward and a three from Katie Santi to make it a 21-20 game. Hubbard went 1-of-2 from the line to close the half with the Rangers up 22-20.Mulnix got his second technical late in the fourth and will not be able to coach Friday"

Babcock says that he went to Hasek after the 2nd goal and he wasn't ready, so he went back to him after the 3rd goal and he was able to get ready and stretch, and he was slightly concerned about Hasek not getting enough warm-ups in, but the Wings were good for the first 10-12 minutes of Hasek's appearance. He feels that the Wings did some good things early, but they were picked apart, the Thrashers scored on their opportunities, and they got away from their good habits. He says that the Wings are a proud group that's determined and tries to play well defensively and play hard, but it wasn't their night tonight, the Thrashers scored on their opportunities and the Wings didn't. He says that he wasn't happy with Osgood's play, he would have finished if Babcock was happy, and he's always concerned about these losing streaks as the Wings were able to pepper the Wild on Friday"

Over 6,000 people flocked to the Cross Creek Commons to take part in the inaugural Cape Fear Italian Festival and celebrate the Italian-American heritage. The event featured all the things Italians do best; food, music, and fun. “Everybody’s having a good time, they're shopping, eating, listening to great music, the Marine band is about to go on here. Looking great!” said Mike Forte. Visitors indulged on old Italian favorites from meatballs subs, pizza, cannolis, and sausage and peppers Music in the air provided a festive atmosphere with a wide selection of great music from the US Marine Corps band, the Wilmington Big Band, the Brunswick Big Band, and Bonita Laserna. These and others entertained and delighted the crowds all weekend long. There was fun to be had with rides and slides for the little ones, while the big boys took to the bocce court. Many enjoyed a casual game, but pride was on the line as Leland Police Chief Tim Jayne took on Wilmington Police Chief Ralph Evangelous. The match was hard fought, with Chief Jayne taking an early lead, but Chief Evangelous pulled out a hard fought victory. The event was honored with the presence of a very special guest as US Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, of Italian decent, paid a visit to the festival. “Best Italian festival in all of North Carolina.

saturday,"Shopaholics: be sure to check out Festivity's other location in Virginia-Highland! Scout Notes: Are you suffering from boutique boredom? Side effects often include deja vu (from seeing the same exact products from other boutiques around town) and credit card-swiping fatigue (from all of those ridiculous prices). Sounds like you need a little celebration in your life. A little something... shall we say... festive? Enter Festivity. Full of unique goods you won't find at any other boutiques in the city at surprisingly wallet-friendly prices, Festivity is the place to go in order to cure yourself of boutique backlash. After all, there's nothing like a little festive retail therapy to get you back in the groove. And if there was ever a perfect place in Atlanta to twirl around in a new dress or model some new bling, it's Festivity. The dresses, shoes, jewelry, and accessories are bound to make you feel like a million bucks (without wreaking quite that much havoc on your wallet). If there were such a thing as an Insta-PartyReady machine, Festivity would be it. The shop is packed with a selection of flirty frocks and fun party dresses that pretty much beckon every gal from out on the sidewalks into the store, whether she has a reason to get gussied up or not. You simply can't resist. But Festivity is much more than festive wear for the partygoer. Their selection of gifts, home goods, and accessories is just as tantalizing to shoppers as the frocks hanging from the racks. Owner and founder Colleen says that's exactly why people love Festivity: the array of goods is so diverse, it's rare that you can walk in here and walk out empty-handed. It's a place where moms and daughters can shop together in harmony, thanks to their extensive selection of diverse, fun, trendy (but not too trendy) pieces. From costume jewelry to finer pieces, the selection of baubles here has caught the eye of many a shopper, thanks in part to the sheer size of the jewelry collection (which, by the way, does include local designers, as well as designers that can't be found in any other Atlanta boutiques). Between the jewels, the dresses, the fall-ready boots, the home decor, and the gifts, there's plenty of things to celebrate at Festivity, boutiqe boredom be damned. Hours: Monday - Saturday"

They are sung every day (unlike those from the Old Testament which, as is, shown above, are only of weekly occurrence). They are placed not amongst the psalms (as are the seven from the Old Testament), but separated from them by the Chapter, the Hymn, the Versicle and Response, and thus come immediately before the Prayer (or before the preces, if these are to be said). They are thus given an importance and distinction elevating them into great prominence, which is further heightened by the rubric which requires the singers and congregations to stand while they are being sung (in honour of the mystery of the Incarnation, to which they refer). Further, while the ""Magnificat"" is being sung at Solemn Vespers, the altar is incensed as at Solemn Mass. All three canticles are in use in the Greek and Anglican churches. In the Breviary the above-named ten canticles are provided with antiphons and are sung in the same eight psalm-tones and in the same alternating manner as the psalms. To make the seven taken from the Old Testament suitable for this manner of singing, nos. 2-7 sometimes divide a verse of the Bible into two verses, thus increasing the number of Breviary verses. No. 1, however, goes much farther than this. It uses only a portion of the long canticle in Daniel, and condenses, expands, omits, and interverts verses and portions of verses. In the Breviary the canticle begins with verse 57, and ends with verse 56 (Dan., iii); and the penultimate verse is clearly an interpolation, ""Benedicamus Patrem, et Filium . . ."". In addition to their Breviary use some of the canticles are used in other connections in the liturgy; e.g. the ""Nunc dimittis"" as a tract at the Mass of the Feast of the Purification (when 2 February comes after Septuagesima); the ""Benedictus"" in the burial of the dead and in various processions. The use of the ""Benedictus"" and the ""Benedicite"" at the old Gallican Mass is interestingly described by Duchene (Christian Worship: Its Origin and Evolution, London, 1903, 191-196). In the Office of the Greek Church the canticles numbered 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are used at Lauds, but are not assigned to the same days as in the Roman Breviary. Two others (Isaiah 26:9-20, and Jonah 2:2-9) are added for Friday and Saturday"

The higher education of carefully selected Negro young men and women, in both academic and industrial lines, is emphasized by this Institution as necessary for the elementary and industrial training of the masses. ""Men of light and leading"" in other spheres of activity are also greatly needed by the race that has so long sat in darkness. Earnestly Christian, as required by its charter, yet entirely unsectarian, the Institution is controlled solely by its own board of trustees, on which several denominations . are represented. Some 300 students are enrolled under 27 officers and teachers. From the college and normal courses 382 graduates have been sent out, nearly all of whom have readily found permanent employment in teaching or other useful occupations. Situated only about seventy miles from the centre of the Negro population of the country, in one of the largest Southern cities, and at the railroad centre of the South, its location is of strategic importance for promoting the. educational advancement of the South. .. . Its plant includes sixty-five acres of land, five large brick buildings, library of 11,000 volumes, apparatus and other equipment worth not less than $250,000. With practically no endowment, with no aid from public or denominational funds, receiving about one-fourth of its support from its own students, the Institution appeals for an endowment of $500,000, and, until that is secured, for $25,000 annually to meet current expenses. Gifts of any amount are welcome, but special appeal is made for subscriptions of $100 and upwards, and for $40 scholarships. Remittances may be addressed to Pres. Horace Bumstead, D.D., Atlanta, Ga.

The SAO is meeting with the presi¬ dents' council (a panel of the presidents of UTSA's registered student organiza¬ tions) to gain input on the proposed policy. According to Hank Phelps, director of the University Center and student activities, students on the president's council want to enforce rules governing posting. Currently, enforcement rests with die SAO. One means of enforce¬ ment involves denying posting rights to those students or groups who do not remove posters within 48 hours afler the end of Ihe advertised event. The current limit is 24 hours.

Davies, assistant professor of history at UTSA, discussed the immediate and long-term effects of the reactionary in¬ solence and what the future holds for Gorbachev and Russian Republic Presi¬ dent Boris Yeltsin. The hu-gcsl and most obvious effect was die end of seven decades of Com¬ munist rule. According to Davies, coup plotters diought that il would be a popu¬ lar revolt because of the depressed stale ofthe Soviet economy and Gorbachev's inability lo deliver on promised eco¬ nomic reforms. The coup only acceler¬ ated the dismantling of Communism because of the citizens' resistance to a regression into a prc-Glastnost state, Davies said. The leader of the reformers, Yeltsin, made a great name for himself wilh the people by calling for civil disobedience during die Soviet slate of emergency. Davies pointed out how little is known about Yeltsin. Whedier he is a true re¬ former or a self-serving politician re¬ mains lo be seen. Davies feels that Gorbachev's prc-coup unpopularity grew wor.se when he did not ideiuify himself with ilic reformers, leaving the future of his presidency an enigma as well. Whatever the outcome of the Soviet Union's political lurnioil, Davis feels, a more pressing issue is weighing heavily on the minds of its eiiizcns.

The prescribed workout was 2-3x3200m with quarter-mile jog; most of us ended up doing 2x3200m then a final 1600m. Splits were 12:56 (6:31/6:24), 13:03 (6:30/6:33), and 6:33 for the last. I let myself run the first one too hard, and the price was that I ended up having breathing issues during the second and third reps (I tried to take a puff of my inhaler after the second rep, but it was broken). A good reminder of why it's stupid to go out too fast. I forced myself to work through the breathing issues though, and I really didn't lose too much time (a drop from 6:30 to 6:33 pace isn't too horrible). Followed with ""2 miles"" (20 minutes) easy pool-running. Foam-rolling plus pilates class in the afternoon. Saturday"""

Well, Baraka offers gourmet glatt and a classy milieu for the observant set -- and gastronomes of any religious bent, for that matter. Upscale kosher restaurants are a rarity in these parts, but Baraka's eclectic menu provides a variety of ethnic cuisine to hold your interest over repeated visits: seared tuna, sushi plates, Mongolian marinated veal chops, Cornish game hens, and tofutti cheese ravioli. The wine list includes whites and reds from Israel, as well as standard Italian and California vintners. Entrée prices are, as our French friends say, dear, running from $24 to $38.

A witness tells Joseph’s story: since July, when M23 began fighting in his village, Joseph has lived in a camp for displaced persons seven kilometers north of Goma. In the morning, he walked to Goma for work. At eleven years old, he took out people’s garbage in exchange for scraps of food. Depending on how much he was able to earn each day, he either slept outside or made his way back to the camp in the evenings. On Monday afternoon, a bomb fell on a house where Joseph was working, killing several people and amputating Joseph’s left arm at the shoulder. Immediately after the blast, a group of neighbors carried Joseph to the road, where a Red Cross vehicle picked him up and carried him to HEAL Africa. By the time he got to the hospital, he had lost so much blood that doctors doubted if he would survive. HEAL’s trauma team worked quickly to tie arteries and replace fluids. Three days after the surgery, Joseph is still too weak to sit, and he doesn’t say much. A representative from HEAL’s media department sits with him, trying to gather information that will help them locate Joseph’s family. On Saturday"

Permission to distribute this document in printed form must be obtained in writing. 1.2 Introduction The original version of this paper was written as a final year undergraduate dissertation in the Department of German Studies at the University of Birmingham (UK). It is my intention to try to keep this work updated, although I cannot guarantee that updates will be regularly published. The format of the first half of this paper is principally chronological, detailing important events, such as the founding of individual extremist parties and subsequent government legislation aimed at curbing their activities. The second half of the paper concentrates on the present-day scene in Germany, with particular reference to the reasons behind the popularity of the right-wing extremists and certain parties, the radical right-wingers and skinheads and the reaction of the Government and the public. 2.0 CHRONOLOGY In 1973, the founder of the neo-Nazi group Bauern- und Buergerinitiative, Thies Christophersen, published a text entitled Die Auschwitz-Luege (The Auschwitz Lie), one of many such revisionist articles to appear in the 1970s and 1980s, culminating in the infamous Leuchter Report. Also in this year, Joachim Floth founded his Deutsch-Voelkische Gemeinschaft (DVG). 1974 saw the arrival of three new right-wing organisations: the Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann (WSG), the Deutsche Sozialistische Volkspartei and the Unabhaengiger Schuelerverbund. In September of the same year, the Rechtsblock fuer Arbeiter, Bauern und Soldaten was also formed, whilst in November, Gary Rex Lauck, an American revisionist, was arrested and expelled for extolling the virtues of National Socialism. In March 1975, the Bund Freies Deutschland won 3.4% of the votes in the elections for the Berliner Abgeordnetenhaus. In April of the same year, the Kampfbund Deutscher Soldaten (KDS) was formed in Frankfurt am Main. Its main policy was one of Holocaust denial, possibly sparked off by Christophersen's Die Auschwitz-Luege and similar publications. In October, the Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands(NPD) was deemed to be an extremist party and to have unconstitutional aims. Proof that banning one party did not prevent the extremists is demonstrated by the fact that in December, Manfred Ohl a former NPD official founded the Nationalrevolutionaerer Bund (NRB). In March 1976 Gary Rex Lauck entered Germany with a false passport and was subsequently arrested in Mainz, before being given a four year jail sentence and fine in July, for spreading Nazi propaganda. He was later expelled from Germany, although he was allowed to return in 1979 to testify at the trial of a neo-Nazi. May 1977 saw Michael Kuehnen, a former lieutenant in the German army, form the SA-Sturm-Hamburg. This marked the start of Kuehnen's career as a neo-Nazi leader. In November he was to found the Aktionsfront Nationaler Sozialisten. In September the Bund Deutscher Maedel (BDM) was formed in Hamburg to follow the ideals laid down by its Nazi namesake. It was in this year that the former Chancellor Willy Brandt called for a crackdown on neo-Nazi activities. Consequently all states were required to submit a report on extremist activity in their regions. In March 1978, the leader of the Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann was sentenced to imprisonment and fined for assembling an arms cache. In 1978 and 1979 the Government banned, or prevented the distribution to minors, of over 50 neo-Nazi publications. On March 17th 1979, the Freiheitliche Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (FAP) was founded by Martin Pappe, an unemployed salesman and teacher. During the summer of this year, the Hilfsorganisation fuer nationale politische Gefangene und deren Angehoerige e.V. (HNG) was founded. This was an umbrella group which aimed to provide mainly financial support for neo-Nazis. Considering the benefactors of the work of this organisation, it is quite surprising that it managed to achieve the status of a registered charity. In September, Michael Kuehnen was arrested for inciting racist attacks and was given a four year sentence, during which he wrote Die Zweite Revolution. Glaube und Kampf (The Second revolution. Belief and Battle), extolling the virtues of a Fourth Reich. His sentence was extended by eight months in April 1992, for sending a copy of this book to Thies Christophersen for publishing.<1> In early December Gerhard Frey founded the Volksbewegung fuer Generalamnestie (VOGA). In 1979 and 1980 a Hollywood television series, entitled Holocaust, was screened throughout Western Europe, including Germany. A survey conducted by a West German television company found that 41% of Germans with televisions saw the final episode of the series, and whilst 75% of these were born after Hitler's rise to power in 1933, and so would have been 12 years old at the end of the war, possibly too young to remember the events in any great detail. The survey also found that 81% of those who watched the final episode discussed it with others and that 65% admitted to being ""deeply moved"" by it.<2> The series was attacked by the NPD's newspaper, the Deutsche Stimme, and the Deutsche National-Zeitung, the newspaper of the DVU, as being Hollywood propaganda, and led to an increase in neo-Nazi activity throughout Germany. In January 1980 Gerhart Baum, the Interior Minister, banned the Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann for being anti-constitutional because of its appeal to the young, although in March, Karl-Heinz Hoffmann took his objections to the Administrative Courtin Berlin, which dismissed the complaint on December 2nd. On September 28th at the Oktoberfest in Munich, a 24lb bomb placed near the entrance, killed 12 people, including the bomber, and injured 312. A neo-Nazi group, initially suspected to be the Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann, claimed responsibility, although it was later discovered that the bomber had left the paramilitary group prior to the attack. On the 24th March 1981, a series of raids on numerous apartments across the Federal Republic, led to the confiscation of a large amount of Canadian and American anti-Semitic material. Wilkinson states that nearly 1,000 homes were raided, although Angelika Koenigseder quotes a figure of about 450.<3> Gary Lauck and Ernst Zuendel, a German Revisionist living in Canada, were subsequently arrested and charged with the smuggling and distribution of banned neo-Nazi propaganda. In April tough new laws were introduced, banning the distribution of anti-Semitic propaganda, including Hitler's autobiography Mein Kampf. On October 24th, 156kg of explosives, 13,520 rounds of ammunition and 1kg of the highly toxic potassium cyanide were found on Lueneburg Heath. In November, Franz Schoenhuber published his book, Ich war dabei (I Was There), celebrating his days in the Waffen-SS. This led to him leaving the CSU, although the right-wing Deutsche National-Zeitung pronounced it to be the ""book of the year"". In its 1981 report, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution declared that crime caused by the right extremists was at its highest level since the end of the Second World War, having recorded 1,824 incidents, an increase of 11% on the previous year. Wilkinson states that: ""Two thirds of these were directly linked to the neo-Nazi groups, and over 300 were anti-Semitic.""<4> In January 1982, the Interior Minister, Gerhart Baum, banned the Volkssozialistische Bewegung Deutschlands/Partei der Arbeit (VSBD/PdA), led by Friedhelm Busse, and the Junge Front (JF). In February the Freundeskreis Ulrich Hutten was founded, whilst in March, Friedrich Ring founded the Deutscher Buergerschutz (DBS) in response to growing crime and an increase in the influx of foreigners. In April the Hamburger Liste fuer Auslaenderstopp was formed. January 1983 saw the merger of the Aktionsfront Nationaler Sozialisten with the Nationale Aktivisten (NA), forming the ANS/NA. On April 1st the Deutsche Freiheitsbewegung (DDF) was formed. In November, former CSU-Bundestagsabgeordnete Franz Handlos and Ekkehard Voigt formed die Republikaner with Franz Schoenhuber. On December 7th, the Interior Minister banned the Aktionsfront Nationaler Sozialisten/Nationale Aktivisten and affiliated organisations. Also in this year, Friedhelm Busse was sentenced to three years and nine months imprisonment for numerous offences involving the possession of firearms. On 28th April 1984, the Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands (NPD) in North Rhein-Westphalia first used skinheads for security at its regional party conference. Vehicles were damaged and political opponents injured. In April, Michael Kuehnen founded the ANS-Auslandsorganisation (ANS-AO), as a precursor to a pan-European extremist movement. On May 26th the Komitee zur Vorbereitung der Feierlichkeiten des 100. Geburtstages von Adolf Hitler (KAH) (Committee for the Preparations for the Celebrations of the 100th Birthday of Adolf Hitler) was formed. At its conference in November, the NPD rejected a motion calling for the party to distance itself from the skinhead movement. In January 1985, the FAP and the Wiking-Jugend formed an umbrella organisation for nationalist groups: the Volkstreue ausserparlamentarische Opposition (VAPO). In March, Voigt and Handlos left the Republikaner and set up the Bayerische Republikaner and the Freiheitliche Volkspartei (FVP) respectively. Also in March, the Soziale Volkspartei was formed in Berlin. At the Erste Europaeische Fuehrerthing in Paris on September 1st, many right-wing organisations decide to coordinate their activities on a European level. In November, two further organisations were formed: the Nationalistische Front (NF) and the Deutsche Aktionspartei/Bewegung der totalen Ordnung (DAP). In September 1986, the Gemeinschaft Eisernes Kreuz EK1 was formed by former members of the FAP, whilst on October 12th, the Republikaner won 3% of the vote in the Bavarian regional elections. In November, Gerhard Frey of the Deutsche Volksunion (DVU), founded the Deutsche Volksliste. On March 11th 1987, the former NPD official Guenter Deckert founded Die Deutschen, whilst on April 17th the Koenigstreue Deutsche Volkspartei (KDVP) was formed. In late August, neo-Nazis demonstrated in Wunsiedel, awaiting the funeral of Rudolf Hess. In September, two more extremist organisations were formed: namely the Arbeitskreis Junge Familie and the Sturmvogel - Deutscher Jugendbund. In January 1988, the Deutsch-Nationale Volkspartei (DNVP) was formed. On 5th April, Fred A. Leuchter published the Leuchter Report in the USA. As an engineer and self-pronounced gas chamber expert, he claimed that the mass killings of the Jews in the so-called ""extermination camps"" could not have taken place. This served to strengthen the beliefs of right-wing extremists, neo-Nazis and Revisionists, that there was no mass-extermination of the Jews under the Third Reich. The Auto- und Buergerpartei (ABD) was founded in September, followed by Die Demokraten in November. On January 2nd 1989, during the campaign for the elections for the Berlin House of Representatives, the Republikaner showed a television advertisement of Turkish children and, in the background, music from the film Spiel mir das Lied vom Tod (Play Me The Song of Death). In the elections later that month, the Republikaner won 7.5% of the votes. However, in June, they won 7.1% of the votes (i.e. two million votes) in the European elections, with a result of 14.6% in Bavaria. In May of that year, the Munich court ordered the withdrawal of a computer diskette containing a program entitled Arier-Test (Aryan Test). In July 1990, former FAP activists formed the Nationale Offensive (NO). After the banning of the Internationaler Revisionistenkongress / Leuchter-Kongress in Munich in March 1991 and the arrest of its organiser Ernst Zuendel, 400 delegates protested in the city. On 25th April Michael Kuehnen, ""outed"" as a homosexual during his three year incarceration between 1985 and 1988, died from an AIDS-related illness. From 17th to 22nd September radical right-wing skinheads rioted outside a residence for foreigners in Hoyerswerda (Saxony) injuring 30 people. This protest triggered numerous other attacks throughout the country in the following weeks, injuring over 100 people. Indeed, during the weekend of the 28th-29th September, police recorded 43 attacks on foreigners, 22 of which were in North Rhein-Westphalia. On the 3rd October, two Lebanese children were critically injured in a fire-bomb attack on a refuge in Huenxe in North Rhein-Westphalia. On the 13th October, a refuge in Immenstadt (Allgaeu) was destroyed by a fire-bomb, seriously injuring two Kurds. On March 14th 1992, a Skinhead concert was held near Weimar, with German groups such as Radikahl and Kraftschlag playing alongside American groups such as Bound for Glory. On April 5th the Republikaner won 10.9% of the votes in the regional elections in Badem-Wuerttemberg, whilst in a Berlin district election in May the party won 8.3% of the votes cast. In July, the Foerderwerk Mitteldeutsche Jugend (FMJ) was founded. From August 22nd to 28th there was heavy rioting outside a home for asylum seekers in Rostock-Lichtenhagen, culminating in an arson attack on the home on the 25th. Between August 29th and September 2nd, there was major rioting outside an asylum seekers refuge in Cottbus. On November 23rd one Turkish woman and two Turkish children were killed and nine others injured when neo-Nazis set fire to their refuge in Moelln (Schleswig-Holstein). Four days later the Nationalsozialistische Front (NF) was banned, as was the Deutsche Alternative on December 10th, the Deutscher Kameradschaftsbund (DKB) on the 21st and the Nationale Offensive on the 22nd. The events at Rostock and Cottbus marked the start of a new wave of violence throughout Germany: from September to December 4167 racially motivated incidents were recorded, both the violent and the non-violent, compared with 2169 incidents in the period from January to August.<5> On May 29th 1993, an arson attack on a house in Solingen killed five Turkish women and a girl, sparking off a new surge of extremist violence against foreigners throughout Germany. On August 27th Brandenburg became the first state to ban the use of the Reichskriegsflagge, a symbol used by the neo-Nazis to stir up hatred against foreigners. This move was followed only days later by a similar ban in other states. Joerg Petritsch, a singer with the skinhead group Stoerkraft, was given a two-year suspended sentence for spreading Nazi-propaganda. On October 29th, Cologne police arrested Fred A. Leuchter and charged him with Holocaust denial. On April 14th 1994, when Manfred Kanther, the Interior Minister, published the 1993 Report of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, he stated that he had no intention of banning either the Republikaner or the Deutsche Volksunion (DVU), for fear of driving their 23,000 members underground. Instead, he said, the parties would continue to be carefully monitored by the police. On May 14th, neo-Nazis terrorised foreigners in Magdeburg by shouting ""Deutschland den Deutschen"" (""Germany for the Germans"") and chasing African students into a cafi before beating them with iron bars. On the 17th January 1995, the trial of three men and one woman began in Gross-Gerau. The four are charged with publishing the neo-Nazi booklet Der Einblick in 1993, containing the names and addresses of about 200 political opponents. Despite being withdrawn, some 180 copies are estimated to remain in circulation. The Dignity Report from February 15th 1994 said the following of the publication: ""On the pages of Der Einblick, the top leadership in German neo-Nazi networks issues a call to ""neutralize all anti-German, anti-nationalist forces"" and urge followers to ""stop squandering the enormous violent potential"" of the racist movement and to ""mount successful counter actions."" The publication contains information on intelligence gathering techniques and urges neo-Nazis to cultivate relations with police so that ""data can be gathered without danger to oneself."""" On the 18th January, the Office for the Protection reported that the 1994 figures for right-wing offences in Berlin had risen from 650 in 1993 to 750. On 24th February, the Government eventually banned the FAP, described by Manfred Kanther, Interior Minister, as: ""an anti-democratic group ""which disdains human rights and stirs up xenophobia and racism.""""<6> Similarly, in Hamburg, homes of members of the Nationale Liste were raided. On April 20th scores of neo-Nazis were arrested around Germany for rioting to mark Hitler's birthday. In the same week Guenter Deckert, the leader of the NPD, was sentenced to two years' imprisonment by a court in Karlsruhe for Holocaust denial and incitement to racial hatred. On March 23rd, Hamburg police raided the homes of those who had ordered and received neo-Nazi propaganda from the NSDAP-AO. Almost simultaneously Gerhard (Gary) Lauck was arrested by Danish police in Copenhagen. After much legal wrangling, the Danish Supreme Court confirmed on Friday 21st June that Lauck should be extradited to Germany to face prosecution under German anti-Nazi law. 3.0 The popularity of right-wing extremism The main cause for the rising popularity of the right-wing extremist parties in the mid to late 1980s could, as Betz suggests, be almost completely due to the Parteien- und Politikverdrossenheit (party and political apathy), which swept the country. This can be seen in the fact that at the first elections after reunification, those in 1990, ten million of those registered to vote stayed at home. In March 1989, 81% of all Germans and 90% of Republikaner voters questioned in an EMNID poll believed that the politicians from the mainstream parties were ""out-of-touch"" with the average person. Similarly, 65% of all voters and 88% of Republikaner voters considered the mainstream political parties to be no longer capable of solving Germany's problems. In the same poll, it was discovered that 43% of Republikaner voters had confidence in the party with regard to housing; 40% with regard to unemployment; 18% over the general state of the economy and 80% over immigration. In 1993 48% of Germans were ""very worried"" that politicians were no longer capable of solving the urgent problems facing Germany, such as immigration and the economy.<7> Similarly, in the states of the former East Germany citizens were, after unification, faced with increasing rents coupled with increasing unemployment. This, in turn, led to an increase in crime, which was subsequently blamed on the foreign population, instead of the new policy-makers: the west German government in Bonn. If the politicians cannot solve these problems, then who can? For as Betz states: ""On this view radical right-wing voters are typical floating voters who don't understand ""the intricacies of politics in postindustrial societies"" and therefore fall prey to clever demagogues who dress up empty slogans as viable solutions to real problems.""<8> Therefore it can be concluded that a fair proportion of these ""floating voters"" will be first-time voters. Indeed, the majority of right-wing voters are around 20 years old. Certainly the majority of right-wing extremists are aged between 18 and 30 and are suspected of being responsible for over 75% of extremist violence in 1993. Given this figure, it is not surprising that the largest group among the extremists (33.6%) is that of students and trainees. What is surprising, however, is that the next highest figure is that of the skilled workers and craftsmen, accounting for 28.7% of extremist violence. Evidently, radical right-wing views appear to be something inherent in the younger, educated classes. But why should extreme right-wing views manifest themselves as violence against foreigners? The obvious explanation is racial purity: just as Hitler extolled the Aryan race, modern right-wing extremists see their own racial identity as being superior and something which they want to preserve at all costs. Perhaps one cause of this is an apparent unwillingness of foreigners to integrate into German society. In 1988 the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung conducted a survey amongst young Turks. It found that 65% of males between 20 and 30 years old socialised with Germans, whilst only 26% of their fathers did. Similarly, Petra Kappert, writing in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (25:9:1982), stated that an estimated 50% of Turkish schoolchildren in Germany attend Koran classes: a further example of an unwillingness to integrate into German society and determination to preserve their own culture when abroad.<9> Therefore, the supporters of the radical right may regard foreigners as a threat to their own culture and society. A resurgence of right-wing views could, perhaps, be considered to be an obvious reaction by citizens of a country which lost its own culture and national identity when it lost the Second World War. The occupation of Germany by the allied powers after 1945 led to an influx of English-language literature and film, the latter still being very much in evidence in German cinemas. This loss of national identity can also be seen as a result of the de-nazification process: anyone listening to the anti-Semitic composer Wagner would have been suspected of being a Nazi, as would anyone expressing any form of national pride. 4.0 The Parties 4.1 Die Republikaner As has already been stated, Die Republikaner was formed on the 27th November 1983 by Franz Schoenhuber, as a party politically located between the DVU and the NPD, principally right of centre. However, the major problem facing the German Government is whether Die Republikaner is really, as it states, a coalition of democratic patriots<10>, or whether it is just another right-wing extremist party. On the front of their manifesto for the 1994 council elections in Mainz, the party stated: ""We reject extremism and violence in any form!""<11> However, the party's rhetoric inside the manifesto smacks heavily of right-wing propaganda: ""WE are against the municipal building of accommodation for asylum-seekers, the use of taxes for fraudulent asylum-seekers (about 97%) and the preferential treatment of foreigners in the allocation of state-subsidized accommodation.""<12> Similarly: ""DIE REPUBLIKANER wants: [...] - no foreigners in the police. [...] - the immediate deportation of convicted foreign offenders, crime among foreigners is three times higher than among German citizens.""<13> Whilst these figures are actual statistics, it is clear that the party is using them to its advantage, if not exploiting them. The social policy of the manifesto was designed to withdraw public finance from foreigners' institutions and even the ""anti-fascist / anti-racist"" groups, which the party considers to be a cover for left-wing extremists. Such suspicions of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution cannot be helped by statements of the party leadership, for example in 1993, Schoenhuber, talking about a wartime propagandist, stated: ""... a Nazi propagandist such as Dr. Kurt Kiesinger could become the German Chancellor.""<14> It seems, as the British left-wing magazine The New Statesman & Society claimed in an article entitled ""The hydra-headed monster of Germany"", that: ""So far, no member of the right-wing Republican party has been caught red-handed at violence, and its leaders have been careful to dissociate the part from the extremists methods, if not their aims.""<15> Die Republikaner does not outwardly appear to be courting the votes of the extremists and radicals in Germany. Indeed, it even goes so far as to exclude former members of the NPD or DVU from its ranks, but it does seem to be exploiting the political apathy which has swept over the country in recent years. For as Betz states: ""Appealing to wide-spread xenophobia, growing anti-big business and antiglobal market sentiments, and exploiting growing uncertainty and fears with regard to the future it conformed to the image of a populist advocate of the interests of the small people.""<16> Membership of the party grew from 8,500 in 1988 to 25,000 in 1989, but then declined to 15,000 in 1990. The party's increase in popularity after 1989 could be seen to be a result of its relative success in the 1989 European elections, which: ""provided the party with almost #6 million in state election subsidies, enabling it to expand its organisation considerably.""<17> Since 1992, the party has been under observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and in eight states the German intelligence services have been called in to investigate it. On Friday March 3rd 1995, Saxony joined the list of states which list Die Republikaner as right-wing extremist and hence anti-constitutional. The Interior Minister of Saxony, Heinz Eggert, said of this: ""One thing is quite clear: the declarations of the Republikaner in its manifesto are appear entirely formal. But the wealth of material has shown that the Republikaner systematically defames the free democratic order, defames its institutions, continually contravening the discrimination laws in the areas of race, belief or nationality and shows very little distance from National Socialism. Now die Republikaner is classified as anti-constitutional and that means that it will be investigated by the secret service.""<18> On presenting the 1993 report of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution on April 14th 1994, Manfred Kanther, the Interior Minister, said that the Government had no immediate intention of banning the party: ""... in spite of clear signs that it has links with neo-Nazi activists. [...] The reasoning is that a ban would make martyrs of the party leaders and drive the 23,000 active members underground.""<19> 4.2 Die Deutsche Volksunion The Deutsche Volksunion e.V. was founded in January 1971, by the Munich publisher Dr. Gerhard Frey. The DVU-Liste D was formed as a new party on March 5th 1987, and took over the entire membership of the DVU, although the Liste D was removed in 1991. The membership in 1993 was estimated by the report of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution to be about 26,000, the same figure quoted in 1992, although Dr. Frey insists that the membership is greater. Dr. Frey publishes two party newspapers: the Deutsche National-Zeitung, which sells for DM1,80, and the Deutsche Wochen-Zeitung/Deutscher Anzeiger, priced at DM2,- , which together had a weekly circulation of 110,000 in 1989. Backes and Jesse compare this figure to the 1986 circulation of the Rheinische Merkur/Christ und Welt, which was 122,000 copies per week.<20> The DVU appears to be in a relatively strong financial position and managed to spend over #7 million21 in the Bremen regional elections in 1987, mainly: ""Through the sale of its nationalist media products, a book service and the trading of Nazi memorabilia (medals, coins, etc.)""<22> At a rally in Passau on 2nd October 1993, an auditor declared that the last elections had cost the party DM11,000,000, paid for by Dr. Frey.<23> 4.3 The Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands The NPD was created by members of the Deutsche Reichspartei (DRP) on 28th November 1964, under the leadership of Fritz Thielen and Adolf von Thadden. In 1975 the party launched its newspaper the Deutsche Stimme. The overall aims of the party can be best summed up by the NPD regional leader for Lower Saxony, Horst Nolte: ""The system cannot be ""improved"", it must be superseded! The destruction of the system can only come from forces which develop as its enemies.""<24> The party clearly sets itself Nazi-style aims, with an ideology similar to that of the DVU, and at the party conference in June 1991, Guenter Deckert, a dedicated Revisionist, was elected party chairman, to replace Martin Mussgnug, who left the party in 1990. According to the 1993 report of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the party owes the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg DM438,000 and the Government DM760,000, exactly the same figures quoted in the 1992 report. The party is required to repay a proportion of the advances made by the Government and the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg for election campaigns, according to paragraph 18 of the Party Law, because of poor results in the 1990 Federal Parliament elections and the 1992 regional election respectively.<25> In 1992 the party was thought to have about 5,000 members, compared with 6,100 in 1991, although the 1993 figure remains the same as that of 1992. The party would possibly be looking to increase its membership dramatically in the next few years, in order either to be in a position to meet its debts to the authorities, or at least to have a greater membership base with which to fight the next elections. 5.0 Militant Groups 5.1 The Skinheads The skinhead movement began in Britain in the late 1960s, in response to the homeless, hippies and the growing number of foreigners entering Britain from the Commonwealth. These original Skinheads or ""Skins"" meted out their violence at, or in the vicinity of, football matches and concerts. However, in 1977 a new breed of Skinhead came into existence. The dress code was the same as before: namely the closely cropped hair, tattoos, jeans, braces, Doc-Martens boots, bomber jackets, and T-shirts. This time, though, the ""Skins"" were much more politically active and developed and nurtured links with British right-wing parties. This new generation of Skinhead soon spread its ideas abroad, principally to the USA, Italy, Austria, France and also Germany. Originally, the movement in Germany attacked left-winger and foreigners, principally Turks. In the mid-80s, the Skinhead movement in Germany expanded and violence at football matches increased. After unification, the ""Skins"" gained support in theformer East-German states. In 1993 the Office for the Protection of the Constitution estimated there to be about 5,600 militant skinheads active in Germany, compared with 6,400 in 1992, the majority of whom were aged about 20. According to 1991 statistics, women (called Renees) accounted for only 3% of the movement (just over 150 people). These, incidentally, are not required to shave off all of their hair: only a bit at the back of the head. Not all ""Skins"" fall into the category of right-wing extremists: some groups, such as the Red-Skins or SHARP-Skins (Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice), even defend the rights of foreigners. In an interview published in The Guardian Education, a 24 year old Berliner and SHARP-member, Martin F., replied to the question ""How should the State react to the racist attacks?"": ""The problem is the people who cause the trouble, the radical right-wingers. But the parties that we have now will not solve this problem. When I hear that the right-wingers from Rostock are only in jail for two months it makes my skin creep. Such people should not be judged as criminals but as political criminals. Then the punishment would be more severe. The neo-Nazis will continue whilst they have no fear of stricter penalties.""<26> However, those groups which are right-wing are exceptionally so, with ingrained Machiavellian instincts. Such groups are the so-called ""Nazi-Skins""; ""Fascho-Skins""; ""White-Power-Skins"" or ""Boneheads"". In their propaganda, these groups use Nazi-symbols, such as the Swastika, and slogans, such as Sieg heil!. Propaganda is also spread in the lyrics of Skinhead music groups, such as Stoerkraft and Radikahl. The English band Skrewdriver is also popular in Germany. Their songs are passed around the Skinheads groups on ""demo cassettes"", because of the cost of producing them, although some of the better-known bands are able to have records and compact disks produced. According to the 1993 report of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, many Skinheads are adopting a more traditional appearance to avoid retaliation from the foreigners themselves, left-wing extremists, the police and employers. 5.2 Neo-Nazi Groups According to the reports of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the membership of neo-Nazi groups stood at 400 in 1975, but rose to 1,400 in 1979. The numbers then declined until 1983, when there was slow increase in membership, peaking at 2,100 in 1989 and again in 1991. Such statistics reflect the banning of one group and the founding of another, attracting more members. The peaks in membership seem to be during periods when there were large numbers of neo-Nazi incidents: the 1979 peak was followed in August 1980 by a fire-bomb attack, which killed two Vietnamese and injured two Ethiopians and in September 1980 by the bomb at the Oktoberfest. However, according to the Infiltration Report of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Government figures for membership of neo-Nazi groups are underestimated: "" 1. The Freiheitliche Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, run by notorious neo-Nazi Friedhelm Busse, is estimated by the Office for Protection of the Constitution at 150 members. Yet while ingratiating himself with Busse, Ron Furey [the investigator] was shown Busse's list - 980 members. Busse even claims he has thrown out another 150 for alcoholism. 2. While the government estimates that another group, the Nationale Offensive, has 100 members, Ron Furey found out that the Dresden area cell alone has 150. 3. Meinolf Schoenborn's ""Nationalistic Front,"" which is also banned, is estimated at 130 members. Schoenborn claims an infrastructure of 8,600. Even if Schoenborn is overdoing it, it is apparent from information obtained through an interview between Ron Furey and Schoenborn that the 130 figure is overly conservative.""<27> The chairman of the recently banned neo-Nazi group the FAP, Friedhelm Busse, described by the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Report as someone with ""particular power with German skinheads"" and ""an advocate of overthrowing the government""28, expressed the policy of his party at an extraordinary party conference in Reifenstein/Thueringen on 10th July 1993: ""The aim of the Party is to take total control over Germany. Should this happen, there will be no concentration camps, but work-camps, where the enemies of the German people, and above all foreigners, will carry out useful work. ""Enemies"" of the Party, such as police chiefs who have banned events of the FAP, or newspaper publishers, such as the publisher of ""Bild"", who stir up hatred against the right-wing parties and their take-over of power, can reckon on being shot.""<29> Such rhetoric is specifically engineered to be reminiscent of the Third Reich. The reference to work-camps instead of concentration camps is an exact copy of Nazi rhetoric: the NSDAP fooled the population as a whole into believing that there were no extermination camps. Therefore, it is clear that the policies of such a group advocate the use of Hitler's style of Machtpolitik, or power politics, as do other organisations, such as the Nationale Liste (NL). Similarly, they want the German borders of the Prussian Empire, as demonstrated recently by increased neo-Nazi activity in the Russian town of Kaliningrad, formerly the East-Prussian town of Koenigsberg. A publisher from Schleswig-Holstein is believed to be behind a neo-Nazi organisation calling itself Aktion Deutsches Koenigsberg. The neo-Nazis have strong international connections with Historical Revisionists, as was proven during the Simon Wiesenthal Center's operation: ""1. The Center attached an answering machine to a cold line announcing to any potential caller that he or she had reached The (fictional magazine) Right Way. This was done to provide credibility to Ron Furey's cover should anyone decide to check up on his persona as a journalist. On Friday, February 12, 1993, that phone rang - it was Mark Weber of the Institute for Historical Review, the notorious organization dedicated to the proposition that the gas chambers of Auschwitz are a myth. He had called to obtain a copy of The Right Way. Now, the only people who knew that number were Ron Furey, the Center's senior research staff, and the neo-Nazis in Germany to whom it had been given. Furthermore, several of these people claimed to know Weber quite well.""<30> 6.0 Historical Revisionism This is a prolific school of thought which generates numerous articles denying the Holocaust. In 1976 Dr. Arthur Butz published his Revisionist work entitled The Hoax Of The Twentieth Century. This work, according to Wilkinson: ""... attempts to represent itself as a serious work of scholarship, complete with the academic apparatus of footnotes, bibliography, and references to respected historians of the Holocaust, such as Lucy Dawidowicz and Gerald Reitlinger.""<31> It marked the start of a new style of Historical Revisionism, a style taken up by others, such as David Irving in his book Hitler's War. Perhaps the most infamous Revisionist article is the Leuchter Report of 1988, after its author, Fred A. Leuchter, although this report is considered by historians to be based upon little or no facts whatsoever. Indeed, Leuchter concedes that hydrocyanic compounds, caused by the extremely poisonous chemical hydrogen cyanide (HCN) reacting with the infrastructure of the gas chambers, were to be found at Auschwitz. However, modern advances in communications have enabled the Revisionists, and indeed, the neo-Nazis, to spread their message to a wider audience. There is at least one discussion group on the Internet, where Revisionists try to peddle their ideas and beliefs, although these are frequently shattered by historians quoting hard facts. One article recently published in the ""alt.revisionism"" newsgroup of the Internet is an article on ""Revisionist Method"", taken from Pierre Vidal-Naquet's book Assassins of Memory (Columbia University Press, 1992). It states that: ""The principles of revisionist method can in fact be summarized as follows: 1. Any direct testimony contributed by a Jew is either a lie or a fantasy. 2. Any testimony or document prior to the Liberation is a forgery or is not acknowledged or is treated as a ""rumor."" [...] 3. Any document, in general, with firsthand information concerning the methods of the Nazis is a forgery or has been tampered with. [...] 4. Any Nazi document bearing direct testimony is taken at face value if it is written in coded language, but unacknowledged (or underinterpreted) if it is written plainly. [...] 5. Any Nazi testimony after the end of the year--in trials either in the West, in Warsaw or Cologne, Jerusalem or Nuremberg, in 1945 or 1963, is considered as having been obtained under torture or by intimidation..... 6. A vast pseudotechnical arsenal is mobilized to demonstrate the material impossibility of mass gassings..... 7. Formerly, God's existence was proven by the notion that the existence was contained in the very concept of God. Such was the famous 'ontological proof.' It may be said that for the 'revisionists,' the gas chambers did not exist because nonexistence was one of their attributes. Such is the nonontological proof. [...] 8. Finally, anything capable of rendering this frightening story acceptable or believable, of establishing its evolution or furnishing terms for comparison is either unacknowledged or falsified. [...] Point number seven in the above list is undoubtedly the most interesting, proffering a seemingly garbled argument for Revisionism. Whilst God may be acknowledged as a metaphysical being, it seems unlikely that this sort of reasoning, when applied to the existence of the gas chambers, will suddenly encourage people to accept Revisionist ideas. Much Revisionist ""information"" is circulated via more conventional means through the Noontide Press, The Spotlight and other journals of the Institute for Historical Review (IHR), described by Ken McVay as ""the moving force in the movement to deny the Holocaust"".<32> This California-based organisation was founded by Lewis Brandon, alias William David McCalden, a founding member of the British National Party after breaking away from the National Front in 1975. Wilkinson says of the IHR: ""They go out of their way to sponsor works by neo-Nazis with bona fide academic degrees or some sort of formal position in higher education.""<33> After Brandon/McCalden had left the Institute, Willis Carto, the ultra-right-wing funder of the Institute, took over until being forced out in late 1994. The Simon Wiesenthal Center stated the following about Carto in its report on the infiltration of neo-Nazi groups in Germany: ""Willis Carto is the most influential professional antisemite in the United States. He is the founder of Liberty Lobby, the Institute for Historical Review, the Noontide Press (which distributes a wide range of racist and antisemitic titles), and the Populist Party, whose 1988 Presidential candidate was David Duke. Carto's name came up in nearly every conversation held between Ron Furey, S.W.C. researcher, Richard Eaton, and the neo-Nazis. Literature produced by the Carto organization is widely read by German's radical right. In addition, several of those interviewed know Mr. Carto personally.""<34> 7.0 Extremism in a European Context Whilst the dynamic rise of right-wing extremism in Germany in the 1980s is peculiar to Germany, given the rise to power of the Third Reich in the 1930s, the entire movement must be set in the context of the resurgence in such extremism in Europe in general. In other countries, right-wing radical parties frequently gain significant results in elections, both European and domestic. The Italian party Lega Nord gained 8.7% of the vote in the 1992 parliamentary elections and 8.4% in 1994. Before the 1994 elections, however, Umberto Bossi, the party's leader, entered the party into an alliance with Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia, which placed the Lega Nord in a strong position with almost twice the seats in parliament, when Forza Italia formed the government. In France, the Front National has typically fared well in European elections, gaining 11.0% in 1984 and11.8% in 1989. Jean-Marie Le Pen, the party's leader, gained 14.4% of the votes cast in the 1988 presidential elections, whilst the party as a whole gained 9.7% of the parliamentary votes in the same year. Similarly, in the first round of the presidential elections on April 23rd 1995, Le Pen gained 15% of the votes cast. The Austrian Freiheitliche Partei Oesterreichs has been continually successful at the polls, gaining 9.7% in the 1986 parliamentary elections and 16.6% in 1990, under the leadership of Joerg Haider. However, in the regional elections in Vienna in 1991, the party won 22.6% of the votes. The Vlaams Blok party in Belgium, campaigning for a corruption-free government, is expected to make substantial gains at the elections on May 21st 1995. These elections have been brought forward by seven months, principally as a result of the corruption and scandal surrounding the ""Cools Affair"", following the murder of Andri Cools, the former deputy prime minister, and the subsequent resignation of the foreign minister, Frank Vandenbroucke, and which still threatens to bring down the Secretary-General of NATO and former finance minister, Willy Claes.<35> When such results are compared with those of Die Republikaner, it can be seen that there is greater public support for right-wing extremist parties in the rest of Europe than that shown for the Republikaner. But still Germany receives greater international publicity for virtually any incident connected with the far-right, which almost certainly reflects the dramatic rise of the NSDAP in the 1920s, transformed from a marginal party into the largest in the Reichstag by 1933. 8.0 Combatting the Extremists In 1992 there were two major infiltrations of the right-wing extremist organisations in Germany by foreign organisations: the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC). The SWC investigation was, oddly enough, carried out by an Israeli journalist, posing as an Australian, who gained the confidence of several neo-Nazi figures in Germany, before compiling a report, with the SWC, a copy of which was forwarded to the German authorities. The report states in its findings that: ""1. Germany has passed a series of laws over the years to prevent attempts at Nazi revivalism. These laws are not always enforced, however. In some cases, neo-Nazis have actually been tipped off in advance about impending police raids. [...] 2. Constantin Mayer leads the Dresden area cell of the ""Nationale Offensive"", a group that was recently banned by the government. Although Mayer says he is under constant surveillance, he says he has cordial relations with the police and conducts his business with them ""with a wink and a nod."" 3. Reisz's brother-in-law operates a video studio in Langen which produces Nazi propaganda. Yet the studio continues to operate. 4. One woman, a retired police inspector, was presented by Wolfgang Juchem to Ron Furey and Rick Eaton as an example of his support among respectable Germans. 5. One neo-Nazi leader, Meinolf Schoenborn, has been raided by the police on several occasions. They've obtained his computerized membership list - a phoney, prepared in advance from a local phone directory to confuse the authorities.""<36> The report also shows there to be errors with the official estimates of membership of these parties: ""1. The Freiheitliche Deutsche Arbeiterpartei [...] is estimated by the Office for Protection of the Constitution at 150 members. Yet while ingratiating himself with Busse, Ron Furey was shown Busse's list - 980 members. [...] 2. While the government estimates that another group, the Nationale Offensive, has 100 members, Ron Furey found out that the Dresden area cell alone has 150. 3. Meinolf Schoenborn's ""Nationalistic Front,"" which is also banned, is estimated at 130 members. Schoenborn claims an infrastructure of 8,600. [...]""<37> The authorities are able, given sufficient proof, to declare a party to be anti-constitutional under article 21, paragraph 2 of the Basic Law. This states that: ""(2) 1.Parties which, according to their aims or relationship of their supporters, are intent on interfering with or removing the free democratic basic order or threatening the continued existence of the Federal Republic of Germany, are anti-constitutional. 2.The decision of anti-constitutionalism lies with the Federal Constitutional Court."" Such an example of this is the recent ban imposed on the FAP. According to paragraph 33 (Ban of Replacement Organizations), article 1 of the Party Law: ""It is forbidden to form organizations (replacement organizations), which persue further anti-constitutional aims in place of a party banned under article 21, paragraph 2 of the Basic Law in conjunction with article 46 of the Law of the Constitutional Court, or to continue existing organizations as replacement organizations."" Any offending individuals are liable to forfeit certain Basic Rights, in accordance with article 18 of the Basic Law, although such motions have to be initiated by the Bundestag, the Federal Government or a regional government. The Office for the Protection of the Constitution is the official organization charged with monitoring the right-wing extremist groups, currently with a budget of over 200 million Marks. Geoffrey K. Roberts sees this office as ""institutionalised wariness"" in the light of the 1920s. It has set up three working parties to investigate the problems of right-wing extremism: a group on right-wing terrorism; a group for special measures for fighting right-wing extremism and the Information Group for the Observation and Combatting of Right-wing Extremist Violence. The Office for the Protection of the Constitution can either have a party banned or declared anti-constitutional, which prevents all members of that party from working in the civil service, which would otherwise allow individuals a platform to air their extremist views. 9.0 Public Reaction Perhaps the most obvious and most violent opposition to the right-wing extremists comes from the one diametrically opposed group: the left-wing extremists. The militant left-wingers have demonstrated against the right-wing extremists on numerous occasions, most notably after the 1992 rioting in Rostock, where the left-wingers were immediately arrested when they gathered to attack the right-extremists as they were attacking a home for asylum seekers. Organised around the theme Antifaschismus/Antirassismus, there are several localised groups which take on the right-wing. In 1993 the report of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution recorded 337 violent attacks on the far-right, compared with 390 in 1992. The ordinary citizen has protested vociferously: after the rioting throughout Germany in 1992, the masses turned out to show their feelings on the subject in several town and cities across the country, but especially in those places where the rioting had occurred. In Berlin on November 8th 1992, the eve of the 54th anniversary of Reichskristallnacht, the Nazi purge of the Jews, 300,000 people, among them Federal President Richard von Weizsaecker, protested against right-wing violence in the Berliner Lustgarten, although the demonstration was later disrupted by anarchists.<38> 10.0 Conclusion Whilst it cannot be denied that right-wing extremism and right-wing violence have increased over the past decade, one must question the comments of some critics of Germany, that the Government has just ""stood by and watched"". It is a difficult and dangerous situation which has developed in Germany, and the utmost care needs to be exercised in dealing with it, in order to avoid an escalation of the violence and an increase in the number of subversive groups. The problem with banning individual parties, as has been found in the past, is that it simply drives the activities of the banned group underground, or else, as with the ANS/NA, the members join a similarly oriented group, such as the FAP. Additionally, as Manfred Kanther, the Interior Minister, stated of Die Republikaner, to ban a party is merely to make martyrs of those in the party hierarchy. Thus, by not banning the parties, not only does the Government have a much clearer idea of each individual group and, hence, its membership, but it is also easier for it to monitor the practices of the groups and, to a certain extent, to control them.

Makes it worth while to go out of your way to check out good foreign film. This is a good one, a professional product about a group of very unprofessional thieves in way over their heads.

And that is often the first issue - will the opposing candidate ask for it?

sunday,"208. It might be useful to offer some comment on the role of Stephen Baker. Mr Baker is a highly regarded lawyer who is experienced in working with the police. He is liked and respected by police officers. From his evidence the impression may have been given that he was a lawyer dedicated to Rectangle whose efforts at engagement were frustrated. This is not entirely the case. He is a busy criminal lawyer with a heavy and varied workload. I see from the disclosure documents he was first appointed to the case in late January and had some involvement in issues around the charging of the accused Wateridge. I will return to that matter in more detail a little later in this statement. The point I wish to make at this time, is that in the period which followed his appointment the force was having exchanges with Mr Baker of an entirely different nature. He was at that time representing a man called Curtis Warren who had a few years previously, been described as the U.K.'s leading criminal. Warren was in custody locally, having been arrested in Jersey following a covert operation by the force. Warren, who at one time appeared in the Sunday"

The Constitution also expressly prohibits the appropriation of money in support of any sectarian creed, church, or school. The policy of the State is to afford the fullest measure of religious liberty to all, to discriminate in favour of, or against, no one on account of religious belief, and not to permit the power or resources of the State to be used for the propagation of any form of religion or for the benefit of any religious institution.

sunday,"Shopaholics: be sure to check out Festivity's other location in Virginia-Highland! Scout Notes: Are you suffering from boutique boredom? Side effects often include deja vu (from seeing the same exact products from other boutiques around town) and credit card-swiping fatigue (from all of those ridiculous prices). Sounds like you need a little celebration in your life. A little something... shall we say... festive? Enter Festivity. Full of unique goods you won't find at any other boutiques in the city at surprisingly wallet-friendly prices, Festivity is the place to go in order to cure yourself of boutique backlash. After all, there's nothing like a little festive retail therapy to get you back in the groove. And if there was ever a perfect place in Atlanta to twirl around in a new dress or model some new bling, it's Festivity. The dresses, shoes, jewelry, and accessories are bound to make you feel like a million bucks (without wreaking quite that much havoc on your wallet). If there were such a thing as an Insta-PartyReady machine, Festivity would be it. The shop is packed with a selection of flirty frocks and fun party dresses that pretty much beckon every gal from out on the sidewalks into the store, whether she has a reason to get gussied up or not. You simply can't resist. But Festivity is much more than festive wear for the partygoer. Their selection of gifts, home goods, and accessories is just as tantalizing to shoppers as the frocks hanging from the racks. Owner and founder Colleen says that's exactly why people love Festivity: the array of goods is so diverse, it's rare that you can walk in here and walk out empty-handed. It's a place where moms and daughters can shop together in harmony, thanks to their extensive selection of diverse, fun, trendy (but not too trendy) pieces. From costume jewelry to finer pieces, the selection of baubles here has caught the eye of many a shopper, thanks in part to the sheer size of the jewelry collection (which, by the way, does include local designers, as well as designers that can't be found in any other Atlanta boutiques). Between the jewels, the dresses, the fall-ready boots, the home decor, and the gifts, there's plenty of things to celebrate at Festivity, boutiqe boredom be damned. Hours: Monday - Saturday: 10am -7pm Sunday"

He said he would come at 3 pm, but did not come until 5 pm (this is Israel), and since it was Friday (just before Shabbat) he could not help me.

sunday,"Number 177 Atlanta, Georgia December, 1907 Plans for Inauguration Day Tuesday, the 31st of December, is the day chosen for the inauguration of President Ware. This day has been decided upon partly because it is the nearest available date to the anniversary of the first President Ware's birthday. The program will include exercises in the morning in memory of Edmund Asa Ware, and in the afternoon the installation of Edward T. Ware. We hope to have with us Dr. Charles Cuthbert Hall, vice-president of our board of trustees, and other friends from the North, as well as a large number of graduates of the school and friends in the South. With special pleasure we are anticipating the presence of Dr. Bumstead, who will give the charge to his successor. With Other Schools A hurried trip of three days, covering about five hundred miles and stopping at four schools, can give one but a glimpse into the school life. Yet it may be worth while to set down some of the impressions gained in passing. One morning, about half past ten, I reached Tuskegee. The drive to the Institute does not give one a good introduction to the grounds of the school, for there is no good approach. One turns in at the gates, then turns again before one realizes that the great institution, builded up by that great man, Booker T. Washington and those working with him, is reached. Too much cannot be said of any school which offers an opening to the boy or girl with little knowledge and less money. To make such crude youths efficient contributing members of society is a grand work. Yet it is one that has its limitations. The beginning and the finishing of the process of education do not lie side by side. The school that devotes itself especially to giving students the start on the upward trail must look to other institutions to carry on the work more nearly to completion. In a very real sense Tuskegee Institute and Atlanta University are supplementing each other, the work of one for the masses of the Negro race and that of the other to supply teachers and leaders for a rising people. Several Atlanta graduates have been and some now are connected with Tuskegee. Miss S. H. Porter, an Atlanta graduate, has just returned this year to take charge of the Woman's Department at Tuskegee. A night's ride on the train brought me to the Fort Valley school in the ""wee sma' hours"" of the morning. But the kindly hospitality of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Hunt, known to all Atlanta University people for their loyalty to this school as well as for their success in their own work, sufficed to assure me a welcome even at that unseasonable time and provide for my comfort. This school is certainly doing a fine work. And it is growing. A girls' dormitory is in process of erection, the work being done almost entirely by the principal and the students. The school does not live to itself. In an outlying district a Sunday"

Two days later, the group scored its first hit with a front-page New York Times story about Iraq’s secret purchase of aluminum tubes that, the story said, could be used to produce nuclear weapons (see September 8, 2002). The information for that story came from “senior administration officials” now known to be members of WHIG. The story was the first to make the statement that “the first sign of a ‘smoking gun’ [proving the existence of an Iraqi nuclear weapons program] may be a mushroom cloud” (see September 4, 2002); that same morning, the same message was repeated three times by various senior administration officials on the Sunday"

If ever I might find a kind word for the coming post-bibliographical world it would be this week, when I have to pack up the thousands of volumes in my office and reassemble them a short distance away—they are so heavy, they take up so much room, and so on; but even now, with the crates piled high in the hall, what I see most plainly about the books is that they are beautiful. They take up room? Of course they do: they are an environment; atoms, not bits. My books are not dead weight, they are live weight—matter infused by spirit, every one of them, even the silliest. They do not block the horizon; they draw it. They free me from the prison of contemporaneity: one should not live only in one’s own time. A wall of books is a wall of windows. And a book is more than a text: even if every book in my library is on Google Books, my library is not on Google Books. A library has a personality, a temperament. (Sometimes a dull one.) Its books show the scars of use and the wear of need. They are defaced—no, ornamented—by markings and notes and private symbols of assent and dissent, and these vandalisms are traces of the excitations of thought and feeling, which is why they are delightful to discover in old books: they introduce a person. There is something inhuman about the pristinity of digital publication. It lacks fingerprints. But the copy of a book that is on my shelf is my copy. It is unlike any other copy, it has been individuated; and even those books that I have not yet opened—unread books are an essential element of a library—were acquired for the further cultivation of a particular admixture of interests and beliefs, and every one of them will have its hour. The knowledge that qualifies one to be one’s own librarian is partly self-knowledge. The richness, or the incoherence, of a library is the richness, or the incoherence, of the self. Sunday"""

Before it came along and opened up the eyes of youngsters everywhere to online porn, little boys had to steal from their fathers’ secret stash of Playboy, or, at the very least, the swimsuit of Sports Illustrated. But a study published in CyberPyschology and Behaviour revealed that men between 12 and 17 who regularly viewed porn had sex at an earlier age and were more likely to initiate oral sex. Women who watched pornography at younger age also lost their virginity earlier. “The internet is having some kind of accelerant effect, influencing and changing behavior,” said Shane Krauss, a psychologist from Castleton State College in Vermont, who performed the survey. “Males are having oral sex and losing their virginity much younger when they are exposed to pornography, sometimes by a good three or four years for oral sex or two years for their virginity.” In short, make sure your kids stay on the Disney website, rather than clicking over to X Tube if you want them to remain chaste longer.

Meanwhile new parties are being formed through Facebook to counter, and crowd out traditionally popular organizations like the Muslim Brotherhood. New Parties like the “25th of January Party” — no indication of what it stands for in the name — has garnered hundreds of thousands of “likes”. Another Party, the “Freedom and Justice Party” is a magnet for a secular pro-free-market Egyptians looking for power and position in the new Egypt. But a hundred other parties are being financed, each directed at peeling away one or more demographic groupings from the Muslim Brotherhood. This important work is proceeding as the world is distracted by the violence in Libya. By the time the world is ready to look at Egypt again, the nation will show an entirely different political landscape. It is clear that the little people have lost again, that Egyptians have lost their revolution and that the people simply are not well enough informed to raise up their own alternative to domination by International Finance.

The bank shutdown and the draining of ATM machines have paralyzed businesses and left ordinary people scrambling for cash. The country’s banks had long been a source of pride for Egyptians, with its strong regulatory environment and their lack of investments in the kind of toxic assets that hammered Western banks helped Egypt weather the worst of the global financial meltdown. Two weeks Moody’s Investors Service downgraded its credit ratings for five Egyptian banks. Future loans from international agencies will depend on eliminating those regulations and meeting other benchmarks for “free-market reform”.

sunday,"Six months after the imposition of the new English edition of the Roman Missal, the volume of dissatisfaction has moderated. People seem resigned to the wooden and literal translations (“people of good will,” “enter under my roof”), archaic vocabulary (“dewfall,” “consubstantial,” “oblation”), and inflated language of prayer (“holy and unblemished,” “graciously grant,” “paying their homage”). Such language, so different from the plainspoken words of Jesus in prayer and parable, is in contrast to the directive of the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy of Vatican II: “In this restoration [of the liturgy], both texts and rites should be drawn up so that they express more clearly the holy things which they signify; the Christian people, so far as possible, should be enabled to understand them with ease and to take part in them fully, actively, and as befits a community.” We have also become accustomed to hearing presiders stumble over the convoluted syntax of the prayers and watching them hurriedly turning pages as they wend their way through the labyrinthine new missals. Yet, there is one new expression that involves a significant translation error with serious implications for a proper understanding of the Last Supper as a Passover meal, along with implications for continued Jewish-Christian understanding. In the final analysis, it enshrines poor pastoral theology in the Sunday"

Maybe you meet a person and if feels like you have already known them. For me, the best example I can give is an activity. I have many hobbies I enjoy. In school, I loved sports and played volleyball, basketball, tennis and softball. I loved them all, but the very first day I stepped foot on a tennis court, it felt differently. I immediately knew the movements and excelled at the game. It felt so natural to hold the racket in my hand. I can't really put it into words, but it just feels right. My body just knows instinctively how to place a ball. I can foresee each shot before it happens and I even know if it will hit the mark or go into the net. Ms. Olsen hit the nail on the head when she said that when your body kind of goes on autopilot- and you really excel best when you aren't even thinking about it- those are the activities that jive with your true inner self.

He relished life, worked long and hard with great passion, enjoyed good food, good conversation, telling stories, and educating, stirring people up. He adored Buffalo and the Buffalo Bills and tried to attend as many of their pro football games, in Buffalo or on the road, as he could. He was corny and relished that, too.

TJ Ford and Jose Calderon combined for 16 assists, the Cavs had 13 as a team. If you can't keep those guys in front of you then you have to be cleaner in rotations...yet Delfino seemed to be taking wide open shots all night. --Obviously the 82 points after the 74 the other night shows the Cavs have scoring problems without LeBron.

Recently, my brother came to visit and him, a friend, and I proceeded to try the Clinch at Millers Island. We arrived at around 1pm on 1/18 and got into the water..... we were using assortments of zebra's and copper's and had moderate luck. We saw a bunch of rises, but were having trouble finding the appropriate fly. Even though the fish count wasn't what we wanted it felt great to get out again after all that snow/ice and get back into the groove of things. I plan to make the Clinch my Sunday"

That makes the voting pool deciding this category much smaller than nearly every other one. Although Amour, also nominated for Best Picture is a heavy betting favorite, this is a category where surprises often happen. So don’t count out Norway’s entry Kon-Tiki, an early favorite among members of the Academy’s foreign language committee when it first screened on October 13th, only the second day of competition for the record 71 entries seen this year over the course of two months. The impression it made lasted and Kon-Tiki became one of this year’s five nominees and a crowd favorite. The film, which recounts the 1947 4300 nautical mile journey Norwegian adventurer Thor Heyerdahl took across the Pacific Ocean on a balsawood raft, has become a huge hit in its native country and has been picked up by The Weinstein Company for domestic release on April 19. Directors are Joaquim Roenning and Espen Sandberg (Max Manus) and its producers are Aage Aaberge and Oscar winner Jeremy Thomas (The Last Emperor). Should it win, it would not be the first Kon-Tiki movie to nab an Oscar. Heyerdahl’s own 1951 documentary feature of his journey actually won an Academy Award for that year, marking the first – and only – Oscar winning film in Norway’s history. Could Kon-Tiki be a good luck charm again for the country when the Best Foreign Language Film envelope is opened next Sunday"

Permission to distribute this document in printed form must be obtained in writing. 1.2 Introduction The original version of this paper was written as a final year undergraduate dissertation in the Department of German Studies at the University of Birmingham (UK). It is my intention to try to keep this work updated, although I cannot guarantee that updates will be regularly published. The format of the first half of this paper is principally chronological, detailing important events, such as the founding of individual extremist parties and subsequent government legislation aimed at curbing their activities. The second half of the paper concentrates on the present-day scene in Germany, with particular reference to the reasons behind the popularity of the right-wing extremists and certain parties, the radical right-wingers and skinheads and the reaction of the Government and the public. 2.0 CHRONOLOGY In 1973, the founder of the neo-Nazi group Bauern- und Buergerinitiative, Thies Christophersen, published a text entitled Die Auschwitz-Luege (The Auschwitz Lie), one of many such revisionist articles to appear in the 1970s and 1980s, culminating in the infamous Leuchter Report. Also in this year, Joachim Floth founded his Deutsch-Voelkische Gemeinschaft (DVG). 1974 saw the arrival of three new right-wing organisations: the Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann (WSG), the Deutsche Sozialistische Volkspartei and the Unabhaengiger Schuelerverbund. In September of the same year, the Rechtsblock fuer Arbeiter, Bauern und Soldaten was also formed, whilst in November, Gary Rex Lauck, an American revisionist, was arrested and expelled for extolling the virtues of National Socialism. In March 1975, the Bund Freies Deutschland won 3.4% of the votes in the elections for the Berliner Abgeordnetenhaus. In April of the same year, the Kampfbund Deutscher Soldaten (KDS) was formed in Frankfurt am Main. Its main policy was one of Holocaust denial, possibly sparked off by Christophersen's Die Auschwitz-Luege and similar publications. In October, the Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands(NPD) was deemed to be an extremist party and to have unconstitutional aims. Proof that banning one party did not prevent the extremists is demonstrated by the fact that in December, Manfred Ohl a former NPD official founded the Nationalrevolutionaerer Bund (NRB). In March 1976 Gary Rex Lauck entered Germany with a false passport and was subsequently arrested in Mainz, before being given a four year jail sentence and fine in July, for spreading Nazi propaganda. He was later expelled from Germany, although he was allowed to return in 1979 to testify at the trial of a neo-Nazi. May 1977 saw Michael Kuehnen, a former lieutenant in the German army, form the SA-Sturm-Hamburg. This marked the start of Kuehnen's career as a neo-Nazi leader. In November he was to found the Aktionsfront Nationaler Sozialisten. In September the Bund Deutscher Maedel (BDM) was formed in Hamburg to follow the ideals laid down by its Nazi namesake. It was in this year that the former Chancellor Willy Brandt called for a crackdown on neo-Nazi activities. Consequently all states were required to submit a report on extremist activity in their regions. In March 1978, the leader of the Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann was sentenced to imprisonment and fined for assembling an arms cache. In 1978 and 1979 the Government banned, or prevented the distribution to minors, of over 50 neo-Nazi publications. On March 17th 1979, the Freiheitliche Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (FAP) was founded by Martin Pappe, an unemployed salesman and teacher. During the summer of this year, the Hilfsorganisation fuer nationale politische Gefangene und deren Angehoerige e.V. (HNG) was founded. This was an umbrella group which aimed to provide mainly financial support for neo-Nazis. Considering the benefactors of the work of this organisation, it is quite surprising that it managed to achieve the status of a registered charity. In September, Michael Kuehnen was arrested for inciting racist attacks and was given a four year sentence, during which he wrote Die Zweite Revolution. Glaube und Kampf (The Second revolution. Belief and Battle), extolling the virtues of a Fourth Reich. His sentence was extended by eight months in April 1992, for sending a copy of this book to Thies Christophersen for publishing.<1> In early December Gerhard Frey founded the Volksbewegung fuer Generalamnestie (VOGA). In 1979 and 1980 a Hollywood television series, entitled Holocaust, was screened throughout Western Europe, including Germany. A survey conducted by a West German television company found that 41% of Germans with televisions saw the final episode of the series, and whilst 75% of these were born after Hitler's rise to power in 1933, and so would have been 12 years old at the end of the war, possibly too young to remember the events in any great detail. The survey also found that 81% of those who watched the final episode discussed it with others and that 65% admitted to being ""deeply moved"" by it.<2> The series was attacked by the NPD's newspaper, the Deutsche Stimme, and the Deutsche National-Zeitung, the newspaper of the DVU, as being Hollywood propaganda, and led to an increase in neo-Nazi activity throughout Germany. In January 1980 Gerhart Baum, the Interior Minister, banned the Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann for being anti-constitutional because of its appeal to the young, although in March, Karl-Heinz Hoffmann took his objections to the Administrative Courtin Berlin, which dismissed the complaint on December 2nd. On September 28th at the Oktoberfest in Munich, a 24lb bomb placed near the entrance, killed 12 people, including the bomber, and injured 312. A neo-Nazi group, initially suspected to be the Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann, claimed responsibility, although it was later discovered that the bomber had left the paramilitary group prior to the attack. On the 24th March 1981, a series of raids on numerous apartments across the Federal Republic, led to the confiscation of a large amount of Canadian and American anti-Semitic material. Wilkinson states that nearly 1,000 homes were raided, although Angelika Koenigseder quotes a figure of about 450.<3> Gary Lauck and Ernst Zuendel, a German Revisionist living in Canada, were subsequently arrested and charged with the smuggling and distribution of banned neo-Nazi propaganda. In April tough new laws were introduced, banning the distribution of anti-Semitic propaganda, including Hitler's autobiography Mein Kampf. On October 24th, 156kg of explosives, 13,520 rounds of ammunition and 1kg of the highly toxic potassium cyanide were found on Lueneburg Heath. In November, Franz Schoenhuber published his book, Ich war dabei (I Was There), celebrating his days in the Waffen-SS. This led to him leaving the CSU, although the right-wing Deutsche National-Zeitung pronounced it to be the ""book of the year"". In its 1981 report, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution declared that crime caused by the right extremists was at its highest level since the end of the Second World War, having recorded 1,824 incidents, an increase of 11% on the previous year. Wilkinson states that: ""Two thirds of these were directly linked to the neo-Nazi groups, and over 300 were anti-Semitic.""<4> In January 1982, the Interior Minister, Gerhart Baum, banned the Volkssozialistische Bewegung Deutschlands/Partei der Arbeit (VSBD/PdA), led by Friedhelm Busse, and the Junge Front (JF). In February the Freundeskreis Ulrich Hutten was founded, whilst in March, Friedrich Ring founded the Deutscher Buergerschutz (DBS) in response to growing crime and an increase in the influx of foreigners. In April the Hamburger Liste fuer Auslaenderstopp was formed. January 1983 saw the merger of the Aktionsfront Nationaler Sozialisten with the Nationale Aktivisten (NA), forming the ANS/NA. On April 1st the Deutsche Freiheitsbewegung (DDF) was formed. In November, former CSU-Bundestagsabgeordnete Franz Handlos and Ekkehard Voigt formed die Republikaner with Franz Schoenhuber. On December 7th, the Interior Minister banned the Aktionsfront Nationaler Sozialisten/Nationale Aktivisten and affiliated organisations. Also in this year, Friedhelm Busse was sentenced to three years and nine months imprisonment for numerous offences involving the possession of firearms. On 28th April 1984, the Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands (NPD) in North Rhein-Westphalia first used skinheads for security at its regional party conference. Vehicles were damaged and political opponents injured. In April, Michael Kuehnen founded the ANS-Auslandsorganisation (ANS-AO), as a precursor to a pan-European extremist movement. On May 26th the Komitee zur Vorbereitung der Feierlichkeiten des 100. Geburtstages von Adolf Hitler (KAH) (Committee for the Preparations for the Celebrations of the 100th Birthday of Adolf Hitler) was formed. At its conference in November, the NPD rejected a motion calling for the party to distance itself from the skinhead movement. In January 1985, the FAP and the Wiking-Jugend formed an umbrella organisation for nationalist groups: the Volkstreue ausserparlamentarische Opposition (VAPO). In March, Voigt and Handlos left the Republikaner and set up the Bayerische Republikaner and the Freiheitliche Volkspartei (FVP) respectively. Also in March, the Soziale Volkspartei was formed in Berlin. At the Erste Europaeische Fuehrerthing in Paris on September 1st, many right-wing organisations decide to coordinate their activities on a European level. In November, two further organisations were formed: the Nationalistische Front (NF) and the Deutsche Aktionspartei/Bewegung der totalen Ordnung (DAP). In September 1986, the Gemeinschaft Eisernes Kreuz EK1 was formed by former members of the FAP, whilst on October 12th, the Republikaner won 3% of the vote in the Bavarian regional elections. In November, Gerhard Frey of the Deutsche Volksunion (DVU), founded the Deutsche Volksliste. On March 11th 1987, the former NPD official Guenter Deckert founded Die Deutschen, whilst on April 17th the Koenigstreue Deutsche Volkspartei (KDVP) was formed. In late August, neo-Nazis demonstrated in Wunsiedel, awaiting the funeral of Rudolf Hess. In September, two more extremist organisations were formed: namely the Arbeitskreis Junge Familie and the Sturmvogel - Deutscher Jugendbund. In January 1988, the Deutsch-Nationale Volkspartei (DNVP) was formed. On 5th April, Fred A. Leuchter published the Leuchter Report in the USA. As an engineer and self-pronounced gas chamber expert, he claimed that the mass killings of the Jews in the so-called ""extermination camps"" could not have taken place. This served to strengthen the beliefs of right-wing extremists, neo-Nazis and Revisionists, that there was no mass-extermination of the Jews under the Third Reich. The Auto- und Buergerpartei (ABD) was founded in September, followed by Die Demokraten in November. On January 2nd 1989, during the campaign for the elections for the Berlin House of Representatives, the Republikaner showed a television advertisement of Turkish children and, in the background, music from the film Spiel mir das Lied vom Tod (Play Me The Song of Death). In the elections later that month, the Republikaner won 7.5% of the votes. However, in June, they won 7.1% of the votes (i.e. two million votes) in the European elections, with a result of 14.6% in Bavaria. In May of that year, the Munich court ordered the withdrawal of a computer diskette containing a program entitled Arier-Test (Aryan Test). In July 1990, former FAP activists formed the Nationale Offensive (NO). After the banning of the Internationaler Revisionistenkongress / Leuchter-Kongress in Munich in March 1991 and the arrest of its organiser Ernst Zuendel, 400 delegates protested in the city. On 25th April Michael Kuehnen, ""outed"" as a homosexual during his three year incarceration between 1985 and 1988, died from an AIDS-related illness. From 17th to 22nd September radical right-wing skinheads rioted outside a residence for foreigners in Hoyerswerda (Saxony) injuring 30 people. This protest triggered numerous other attacks throughout the country in the following weeks, injuring over 100 people. Indeed, during the weekend of the 28th-29th September, police recorded 43 attacks on foreigners, 22 of which were in North Rhein-Westphalia. On the 3rd October, two Lebanese children were critically injured in a fire-bomb attack on a refuge in Huenxe in North Rhein-Westphalia. On the 13th October, a refuge in Immenstadt (Allgaeu) was destroyed by a fire-bomb, seriously injuring two Kurds. On March 14th 1992, a Skinhead concert was held near Weimar, with German groups such as Radikahl and Kraftschlag playing alongside American groups such as Bound for Glory. On April 5th the Republikaner won 10.9% of the votes in the regional elections in Badem-Wuerttemberg, whilst in a Berlin district election in May the party won 8.3% of the votes cast. In July, the Foerderwerk Mitteldeutsche Jugend (FMJ) was founded. From August 22nd to 28th there was heavy rioting outside a home for asylum seekers in Rostock-Lichtenhagen, culminating in an arson attack on the home on the 25th. Between August 29th and September 2nd, there was major rioting outside an asylum seekers refuge in Cottbus. On November 23rd one Turkish woman and two Turkish children were killed and nine others injured when neo-Nazis set fire to their refuge in Moelln (Schleswig-Holstein). Four days later the Nationalsozialistische Front (NF) was banned, as was the Deutsche Alternative on December 10th, the Deutscher Kameradschaftsbund (DKB) on the 21st and the Nationale Offensive on the 22nd. The events at Rostock and Cottbus marked the start of a new wave of violence throughout Germany: from September to December 4167 racially motivated incidents were recorded, both the violent and the non-violent, compared with 2169 incidents in the period from January to August.<5> On May 29th 1993, an arson attack on a house in Solingen killed five Turkish women and a girl, sparking off a new surge of extremist violence against foreigners throughout Germany. On August 27th Brandenburg became the first state to ban the use of the Reichskriegsflagge, a symbol used by the neo-Nazis to stir up hatred against foreigners. This move was followed only days later by a similar ban in other states. Joerg Petritsch, a singer with the skinhead group Stoerkraft, was given a two-year suspended sentence for spreading Nazi-propaganda. On October 29th, Cologne police arrested Fred A. Leuchter and charged him with Holocaust denial. On April 14th 1994, when Manfred Kanther, the Interior Minister, published the 1993 Report of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, he stated that he had no intention of banning either the Republikaner or the Deutsche Volksunion (DVU), for fear of driving their 23,000 members underground. Instead, he said, the parties would continue to be carefully monitored by the police. On May 14th, neo-Nazis terrorised foreigners in Magdeburg by shouting ""Deutschland den Deutschen"" (""Germany for the Germans"") and chasing African students into a cafi before beating them with iron bars. On the 17th January 1995, the trial of three men and one woman began in Gross-Gerau. The four are charged with publishing the neo-Nazi booklet Der Einblick in 1993, containing the names and addresses of about 200 political opponents. Despite being withdrawn, some 180 copies are estimated to remain in circulation. The Dignity Report from February 15th 1994 said the following of the publication: ""On the pages of Der Einblick, the top leadership in German neo-Nazi networks issues a call to ""neutralize all anti-German, anti-nationalist forces"" and urge followers to ""stop squandering the enormous violent potential"" of the racist movement and to ""mount successful counter actions."" The publication contains information on intelligence gathering techniques and urges neo-Nazis to cultivate relations with police so that ""data can be gathered without danger to oneself."""" On the 18th January, the Office for the Protection reported that the 1994 figures for right-wing offences in Berlin had risen from 650 in 1993 to 750. On 24th February, the Government eventually banned the FAP, described by Manfred Kanther, Interior Minister, as: ""an anti-democratic group ""which disdains human rights and stirs up xenophobia and racism.""""<6> Similarly, in Hamburg, homes of members of the Nationale Liste were raided. On April 20th scores of neo-Nazis were arrested around Germany for rioting to mark Hitler's birthday. In the same week Guenter Deckert, the leader of the NPD, was sentenced to two years' imprisonment by a court in Karlsruhe for Holocaust denial and incitement to racial hatred. On March 23rd, Hamburg police raided the homes of those who had ordered and received neo-Nazi propaganda from the NSDAP-AO. Almost simultaneously Gerhard (Gary) Lauck was arrested by Danish police in Copenhagen. After much legal wrangling, the Danish Supreme Court confirmed on Friday 21st June that Lauck should be extradited to Germany to face prosecution under German anti-Nazi law. 3.0 The popularity of right-wing extremism The main cause for the rising popularity of the right-wing extremist parties in the mid to late 1980s could, as Betz suggests, be almost completely due to the Parteien- und Politikverdrossenheit (party and political apathy), which swept the country. This can be seen in the fact that at the first elections after reunification, those in 1990, ten million of those registered to vote stayed at home. In March 1989, 81% of all Germans and 90% of Republikaner voters questioned in an EMNID poll believed that the politicians from the mainstream parties were ""out-of-touch"" with the average person. Similarly, 65% of all voters and 88% of Republikaner voters considered the mainstream political parties to be no longer capable of solving Germany's problems. In the same poll, it was discovered that 43% of Republikaner voters had confidence in the party with regard to housing; 40% with regard to unemployment; 18% over the general state of the economy and 80% over immigration. In 1993 48% of Germans were ""very worried"" that politicians were no longer capable of solving the urgent problems facing Germany, such as immigration and the economy.<7> Similarly, in the states of the former East Germany citizens were, after unification, faced with increasing rents coupled with increasing unemployment. This, in turn, led to an increase in crime, which was subsequently blamed on the foreign population, instead of the new policy-makers: the west German government in Bonn. If the politicians cannot solve these problems, then who can? For as Betz states: ""On this view radical right-wing voters are typical floating voters who don't understand ""the intricacies of politics in postindustrial societies"" and therefore fall prey to clever demagogues who dress up empty slogans as viable solutions to real problems.""<8> Therefore it can be concluded that a fair proportion of these ""floating voters"" will be first-time voters. Indeed, the majority of right-wing voters are around 20 years old. Certainly the majority of right-wing extremists are aged between 18 and 30 and are suspected of being responsible for over 75% of extremist violence in 1993. Given this figure, it is not surprising that the largest group among the extremists (33.6%) is that of students and trainees. What is surprising, however, is that the next highest figure is that of the skilled workers and craftsmen, accounting for 28.7% of extremist violence. Evidently, radical right-wing views appear to be something inherent in the younger, educated classes. But why should extreme right-wing views manifest themselves as violence against foreigners? The obvious explanation is racial purity: just as Hitler extolled the Aryan race, modern right-wing extremists see their own racial identity as being superior and something which they want to preserve at all costs. Perhaps one cause of this is an apparent unwillingness of foreigners to integrate into German society. In 1988 the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung conducted a survey amongst young Turks. It found that 65% of males between 20 and 30 years old socialised with Germans, whilst only 26% of their fathers did. Similarly, Petra Kappert, writing in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (25:9:1982), stated that an estimated 50% of Turkish schoolchildren in Germany attend Koran classes: a further example of an unwillingness to integrate into German society and determination to preserve their own culture when abroad.<9> Therefore, the supporters of the radical right may regard foreigners as a threat to their own culture and society. A resurgence of right-wing views could, perhaps, be considered to be an obvious reaction by citizens of a country which lost its own culture and national identity when it lost the Second World War. The occupation of Germany by the allied powers after 1945 led to an influx of English-language literature and film, the latter still being very much in evidence in German cinemas. This loss of national identity can also be seen as a result of the de-nazification process: anyone listening to the anti-Semitic composer Wagner would have been suspected of being a Nazi, as would anyone expressing any form of national pride. 4.0 The Parties 4.1 Die Republikaner As has already been stated, Die Republikaner was formed on the 27th November 1983 by Franz Schoenhuber, as a party politically located between the DVU and the NPD, principally right of centre. However, the major problem facing the German Government is whether Die Republikaner is really, as it states, a coalition of democratic patriots<10>, or whether it is just another right-wing extremist party. On the front of their manifesto for the 1994 council elections in Mainz, the party stated: ""We reject extremism and violence in any form!""<11> However, the party's rhetoric inside the manifesto smacks heavily of right-wing propaganda: ""WE are against the municipal building of accommodation for asylum-seekers, the use of taxes for fraudulent asylum-seekers (about 97%) and the preferential treatment of foreigners in the allocation of state-subsidized accommodation.""<12> Similarly: ""DIE REPUBLIKANER wants: [...] - no foreigners in the police. [...] - the immediate deportation of convicted foreign offenders, crime among foreigners is three times higher than among German citizens.""<13> Whilst these figures are actual statistics, it is clear that the party is using them to its advantage, if not exploiting them. The social policy of the manifesto was designed to withdraw public finance from foreigners' institutions and even the ""anti-fascist / anti-racist"" groups, which the party considers to be a cover for left-wing extremists. Such suspicions of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution cannot be helped by statements of the party leadership, for example in 1993, Schoenhuber, talking about a wartime propagandist, stated: ""... a Nazi propagandist such as Dr. Kurt Kiesinger could become the German Chancellor.""<14> It seems, as the British left-wing magazine The New Statesman & Society claimed in an article entitled ""The hydra-headed monster of Germany"", that: ""So far, no member of the right-wing Republican party has been caught red-handed at violence, and its leaders have been careful to dissociate the part from the extremists methods, if not their aims.""<15> Die Republikaner does not outwardly appear to be courting the votes of the extremists and radicals in Germany. Indeed, it even goes so far as to exclude former members of the NPD or DVU from its ranks, but it does seem to be exploiting the political apathy which has swept over the country in recent years. For as Betz states: ""Appealing to wide-spread xenophobia, growing anti-big business and antiglobal market sentiments, and exploiting growing uncertainty and fears with regard to the future it conformed to the image of a populist advocate of the interests of the small people.""<16> Membership of the party grew from 8,500 in 1988 to 25,000 in 1989, but then declined to 15,000 in 1990. The party's increase in popularity after 1989 could be seen to be a result of its relative success in the 1989 European elections, which: ""provided the party with almost #6 million in state election subsidies, enabling it to expand its organisation considerably.""<17> Since 1992, the party has been under observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and in eight states the German intelligence services have been called in to investigate it. On Friday March 3rd 1995, Saxony joined the list of states which list Die Republikaner as right-wing extremist and hence anti-constitutional. The Interior Minister of Saxony, Heinz Eggert, said of this: ""One thing is quite clear: the declarations of the Republikaner in its manifesto are appear entirely formal. But the wealth of material has shown that the Republikaner systematically defames the free democratic order, defames its institutions, continually contravening the discrimination laws in the areas of race, belief or nationality and shows very little distance from National Socialism. Now die Republikaner is classified as anti-constitutional and that means that it will be investigated by the secret service.""<18> On presenting the 1993 report of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution on April 14th 1994, Manfred Kanther, the Interior Minister, said that the Government had no immediate intention of banning the party: ""... in spite of clear signs that it has links with neo-Nazi activists. [...] The reasoning is that a ban would make martyrs of the party leaders and drive the 23,000 active members underground.""<19> 4.2 Die Deutsche Volksunion The Deutsche Volksunion e.V. was founded in January 1971, by the Munich publisher Dr. Gerhard Frey. The DVU-Liste D was formed as a new party on March 5th 1987, and took over the entire membership of the DVU, although the Liste D was removed in 1991. The membership in 1993 was estimated by the report of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution to be about 26,000, the same figure quoted in 1992, although Dr. Frey insists that the membership is greater. Dr. Frey publishes two party newspapers: the Deutsche National-Zeitung, which sells for DM1,80, and the Deutsche Wochen-Zeitung/Deutscher Anzeiger, priced at DM2,- , which together had a weekly circulation of 110,000 in 1989. Backes and Jesse compare this figure to the 1986 circulation of the Rheinische Merkur/Christ und Welt, which was 122,000 copies per week.<20> The DVU appears to be in a relatively strong financial position and managed to spend over #7 million21 in the Bremen regional elections in 1987, mainly: ""Through the sale of its nationalist media products, a book service and the trading of Nazi memorabilia (medals, coins, etc.)""<22> At a rally in Passau on 2nd October 1993, an auditor declared that the last elections had cost the party DM11,000,000, paid for by Dr. Frey.<23> 4.3 The Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands The NPD was created by members of the Deutsche Reichspartei (DRP) on 28th November 1964, under the leadership of Fritz Thielen and Adolf von Thadden. In 1975 the party launched its newspaper the Deutsche Stimme. The overall aims of the party can be best summed up by the NPD regional leader for Lower Saxony, Horst Nolte: ""The system cannot be ""improved"", it must be superseded! The destruction of the system can only come from forces which develop as its enemies.""<24> The party clearly sets itself Nazi-style aims, with an ideology similar to that of the DVU, and at the party conference in June 1991, Guenter Deckert, a dedicated Revisionist, was elected party chairman, to replace Martin Mussgnug, who left the party in 1990. According to the 1993 report of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the party owes the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg DM438,000 and the Government DM760,000, exactly the same figures quoted in the 1992 report. The party is required to repay a proportion of the advances made by the Government and the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg for election campaigns, according to paragraph 18 of the Party Law, because of poor results in the 1990 Federal Parliament elections and the 1992 regional election respectively.<25> In 1992 the party was thought to have about 5,000 members, compared with 6,100 in 1991, although the 1993 figure remains the same as that of 1992. The party would possibly be looking to increase its membership dramatically in the next few years, in order either to be in a position to meet its debts to the authorities, or at least to have a greater membership base with which to fight the next elections. 5.0 Militant Groups 5.1 The Skinheads The skinhead movement began in Britain in the late 1960s, in response to the homeless, hippies and the growing number of foreigners entering Britain from the Commonwealth. These original Skinheads or ""Skins"" meted out their violence at, or in the vicinity of, football matches and concerts. However, in 1977 a new breed of Skinhead came into existence. The dress code was the same as before: namely the closely cropped hair, tattoos, jeans, braces, Doc-Martens boots, bomber jackets, and T-shirts. This time, though, the ""Skins"" were much more politically active and developed and nurtured links with British right-wing parties. This new generation of Skinhead soon spread its ideas abroad, principally to the USA, Italy, Austria, France and also Germany. Originally, the movement in Germany attacked left-winger and foreigners, principally Turks. In the mid-80s, the Skinhead movement in Germany expanded and violence at football matches increased. After unification, the ""Skins"" gained support in theformer East-German states. In 1993 the Office for the Protection of the Constitution estimated there to be about 5,600 militant skinheads active in Germany, compared with 6,400 in 1992, the majority of whom were aged about 20. According to 1991 statistics, women (called Renees) accounted for only 3% of the movement (just over 150 people). These, incidentally, are not required to shave off all of their hair: only a bit at the back of the head. Not all ""Skins"" fall into the category of right-wing extremists: some groups, such as the Red-Skins or SHARP-Skins (Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice), even defend the rights of foreigners. In an interview published in The Guardian Education, a 24 year old Berliner and SHARP-member, Martin F., replied to the question ""How should the State react to the racist attacks?"": ""The problem is the people who cause the trouble, the radical right-wingers. But the parties that we have now will not solve this problem. When I hear that the right-wingers from Rostock are only in jail for two months it makes my skin creep. Such people should not be judged as criminals but as political criminals. Then the punishment would be more severe. The neo-Nazis will continue whilst they have no fear of stricter penalties.""<26> However, those groups which are right-wing are exceptionally so, with ingrained Machiavellian instincts. Such groups are the so-called ""Nazi-Skins""; ""Fascho-Skins""; ""White-Power-Skins"" or ""Boneheads"". In their propaganda, these groups use Nazi-symbols, such as the Swastika, and slogans, such as Sieg heil!. Propaganda is also spread in the lyrics of Skinhead music groups, such as Stoerkraft and Radikahl. The English band Skrewdriver is also popular in Germany. Their songs are passed around the Skinheads groups on ""demo cassettes"", because of the cost of producing them, although some of the better-known bands are able to have records and compact disks produced. According to the 1993 report of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, many Skinheads are adopting a more traditional appearance to avoid retaliation from the foreigners themselves, left-wing extremists, the police and employers. 5.2 Neo-Nazi Groups According to the reports of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the membership of neo-Nazi groups stood at 400 in 1975, but rose to 1,400 in 1979. The numbers then declined until 1983, when there was slow increase in membership, peaking at 2,100 in 1989 and again in 1991. Such statistics reflect the banning of one group and the founding of another, attracting more members. The peaks in membership seem to be during periods when there were large numbers of neo-Nazi incidents: the 1979 peak was followed in August 1980 by a fire-bomb attack, which killed two Vietnamese and injured two Ethiopians and in September 1980 by the bomb at the Oktoberfest. However, according to the Infiltration Report of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Government figures for membership of neo-Nazi groups are underestimated: "" 1. The Freiheitliche Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, run by notorious neo-Nazi Friedhelm Busse, is estimated by the Office for Protection of the Constitution at 150 members. Yet while ingratiating himself with Busse, Ron Furey [the investigator] was shown Busse's list - 980 members. Busse even claims he has thrown out another 150 for alcoholism. 2. While the government estimates that another group, the Nationale Offensive, has 100 members, Ron Furey found out that the Dresden area cell alone has 150. 3. Meinolf Schoenborn's ""Nationalistic Front,"" which is also banned, is estimated at 130 members. Schoenborn claims an infrastructure of 8,600. Even if Schoenborn is overdoing it, it is apparent from information obtained through an interview between Ron Furey and Schoenborn that the 130 figure is overly conservative.""<27> The chairman of the recently banned neo-Nazi group the FAP, Friedhelm Busse, described by the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Report as someone with ""particular power with German skinheads"" and ""an advocate of overthrowing the government""28, expressed the policy of his party at an extraordinary party conference in Reifenstein/Thueringen on 10th July 1993: ""The aim of the Party is to take total control over Germany. Should this happen, there will be no concentration camps, but work-camps, where the enemies of the German people, and above all foreigners, will carry out useful work. ""Enemies"" of the Party, such as police chiefs who have banned events of the FAP, or newspaper publishers, such as the publisher of ""Bild"", who stir up hatred against the right-wing parties and their take-over of power, can reckon on being shot.""<29> Such rhetoric is specifically engineered to be reminiscent of the Third Reich. The reference to work-camps instead of concentration camps is an exact copy of Nazi rhetoric: the NSDAP fooled the population as a whole into believing that there were no extermination camps. Therefore, it is clear that the policies of such a group advocate the use of Hitler's style of Machtpolitik, or power politics, as do other organisations, such as the Nationale Liste (NL). Similarly, they want the German borders of the Prussian Empire, as demonstrated recently by increased neo-Nazi activity in the Russian town of Kaliningrad, formerly the East-Prussian town of Koenigsberg. A publisher from Schleswig-Holstein is believed to be behind a neo-Nazi organisation calling itself Aktion Deutsches Koenigsberg. The neo-Nazis have strong international connections with Historical Revisionists, as was proven during the Simon Wiesenthal Center's operation: ""1. The Center attached an answering machine to a cold line announcing to any potential caller that he or she had reached The (fictional magazine) Right Way. This was done to provide credibility to Ron Furey's cover should anyone decide to check up on his persona as a journalist. On Friday, February 12, 1993, that phone rang - it was Mark Weber of the Institute for Historical Review, the notorious organization dedicated to the proposition that the gas chambers of Auschwitz are a myth. He had called to obtain a copy of The Right Way. Now, the only people who knew that number were Ron Furey, the Center's senior research staff, and the neo-Nazis in Germany to whom it had been given. Furthermore, several of these people claimed to know Weber quite well.""<30> 6.0 Historical Revisionism This is a prolific school of thought which generates numerous articles denying the Holocaust. In 1976 Dr. Arthur Butz published his Revisionist work entitled The Hoax Of The Twentieth Century. This work, according to Wilkinson: ""... attempts to represent itself as a serious work of scholarship, complete with the academic apparatus of footnotes, bibliography, and references to respected historians of the Holocaust, such as Lucy Dawidowicz and Gerald Reitlinger.""<31> It marked the start of a new style of Historical Revisionism, a style taken up by others, such as David Irving in his book Hitler's War. Perhaps the most infamous Revisionist article is the Leuchter Report of 1988, after its author, Fred A. Leuchter, although this report is considered by historians to be based upon little or no facts whatsoever. Indeed, Leuchter concedes that hydrocyanic compounds, caused by the extremely poisonous chemical hydrogen cyanide (HCN) reacting with the infrastructure of the gas chambers, were to be found at Auschwitz. However, modern advances in communications have enabled the Revisionists, and indeed, the neo-Nazis, to spread their message to a wider audience. There is at least one discussion group on the Internet, where Revisionists try to peddle their ideas and beliefs, although these are frequently shattered by historians quoting hard facts. One article recently published in the ""alt.revisionism"" newsgroup of the Internet is an article on ""Revisionist Method"", taken from Pierre Vidal-Naquet's book Assassins of Memory (Columbia University Press, 1992). It states that: ""The principles of revisionist method can in fact be summarized as follows: 1. Any direct testimony contributed by a Jew is either a lie or a fantasy. 2. Any testimony or document prior to the Liberation is a forgery or is not acknowledged or is treated as a ""rumor."" [...] 3. Any document, in general, with firsthand information concerning the methods of the Nazis is a forgery or has been tampered with. [...] 4. Any Nazi document bearing direct testimony is taken at face value if it is written in coded language, but unacknowledged (or underinterpreted) if it is written plainly. [...] 5. Any Nazi testimony after the end of the year--in trials either in the West, in Warsaw or Cologne, Jerusalem or Nuremberg, in 1945 or 1963, is considered as having been obtained under torture or by intimidation..... 6. A vast pseudotechnical arsenal is mobilized to demonstrate the material impossibility of mass gassings..... 7. Formerly, God's existence was proven by the notion that the existence was contained in the very concept of God. Such was the famous 'ontological proof.' It may be said that for the 'revisionists,' the gas chambers did not exist because nonexistence was one of their attributes. Such is the nonontological proof. [...] 8. Finally, anything capable of rendering this frightening story acceptable or believable, of establishing its evolution or furnishing terms for comparison is either unacknowledged or falsified. [...] Point number seven in the above list is undoubtedly the most interesting, proffering a seemingly garbled argument for Revisionism. Whilst God may be acknowledged as a metaphysical being, it seems unlikely that this sort of reasoning, when applied to the existence of the gas chambers, will suddenly encourage people to accept Revisionist ideas. Much Revisionist ""information"" is circulated via more conventional means through the Noontide Press, The Spotlight and other journals of the Institute for Historical Review (IHR), described by Ken McVay as ""the moving force in the movement to deny the Holocaust"".<32> This California-based organisation was founded by Lewis Brandon, alias William David McCalden, a founding member of the British National Party after breaking away from the National Front in 1975. Wilkinson says of the IHR: ""They go out of their way to sponsor works by neo-Nazis with bona fide academic degrees or some sort of formal position in higher education.""<33> After Brandon/McCalden had left the Institute, Willis Carto, the ultra-right-wing funder of the Institute, took over until being forced out in late 1994. The Simon Wiesenthal Center stated the following about Carto in its report on the infiltration of neo-Nazi groups in Germany: ""Willis Carto is the most influential professional antisemite in the United States. He is the founder of Liberty Lobby, the Institute for Historical Review, the Noontide Press (which distributes a wide range of racist and antisemitic titles), and the Populist Party, whose 1988 Presidential candidate was David Duke. Carto's name came up in nearly every conversation held between Ron Furey, S.W.C. researcher, Richard Eaton, and the neo-Nazis. Literature produced by the Carto organization is widely read by German's radical right. In addition, several of those interviewed know Mr. Carto personally.""<34> 7.0 Extremism in a European Context Whilst the dynamic rise of right-wing extremism in Germany in the 1980s is peculiar to Germany, given the rise to power of the Third Reich in the 1930s, the entire movement must be set in the context of the resurgence in such extremism in Europe in general. In other countries, right-wing radical parties frequently gain significant results in elections, both European and domestic. The Italian party Lega Nord gained 8.7% of the vote in the 1992 parliamentary elections and 8.4% in 1994. Before the 1994 elections, however, Umberto Bossi, the party's leader, entered the party into an alliance with Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia, which placed the Lega Nord in a strong position with almost twice the seats in parliament, when Forza Italia formed the government. In France, the Front National has typically fared well in European elections, gaining 11.0% in 1984 and11.8% in 1989. Jean-Marie Le Pen, the party's leader, gained 14.4% of the votes cast in the 1988 presidential elections, whilst the party as a whole gained 9.7% of the parliamentary votes in the same year. Similarly, in the first round of the presidential elections on April 23rd 1995, Le Pen gained 15% of the votes cast. The Austrian Freiheitliche Partei Oesterreichs has been continually successful at the polls, gaining 9.7% in the 1986 parliamentary elections and 16.6% in 1990, under the leadership of Joerg Haider. However, in the regional elections in Vienna in 1991, the party won 22.6% of the votes. The Vlaams Blok party in Belgium, campaigning for a corruption-free government, is expected to make substantial gains at the elections on May 21st 1995. These elections have been brought forward by seven months, principally as a result of the corruption and scandal surrounding the ""Cools Affair"", following the murder of Andri Cools, the former deputy prime minister, and the subsequent resignation of the foreign minister, Frank Vandenbroucke, and which still threatens to bring down the Secretary-General of NATO and former finance minister, Willy Claes.<35> When such results are compared with those of Die Republikaner, it can be seen that there is greater public support for right-wing extremist parties in the rest of Europe than that shown for the Republikaner. But still Germany receives greater international publicity for virtually any incident connected with the far-right, which almost certainly reflects the dramatic rise of the NSDAP in the 1920s, transformed from a marginal party into the largest in the Reichstag by 1933. 8.0 Combatting the Extremists In 1992 there were two major infiltrations of the right-wing extremist organisations in Germany by foreign organisations: the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC). The SWC investigation was, oddly enough, carried out by an Israeli journalist, posing as an Australian, who gained the confidence of several neo-Nazi figures in Germany, before compiling a report, with the SWC, a copy of which was forwarded to the German authorities. The report states in its findings that: ""1. Germany has passed a series of laws over the years to prevent attempts at Nazi revivalism. These laws are not always enforced, however. In some cases, neo-Nazis have actually been tipped off in advance about impending police raids. [...] 2. Constantin Mayer leads the Dresden area cell of the ""Nationale Offensive"", a group that was recently banned by the government. Although Mayer says he is under constant surveillance, he says he has cordial relations with the police and conducts his business with them ""with a wink and a nod."" 3. Reisz's brother-in-law operates a video studio in Langen which produces Nazi propaganda. Yet the studio continues to operate. 4. One woman, a retired police inspector, was presented by Wolfgang Juchem to Ron Furey and Rick Eaton as an example of his support among respectable Germans. 5. One neo-Nazi leader, Meinolf Schoenborn, has been raided by the police on several occasions. They've obtained his computerized membership list - a phoney, prepared in advance from a local phone directory to confuse the authorities.""<36> The report also shows there to be errors with the official estimates of membership of these parties: ""1. The Freiheitliche Deutsche Arbeiterpartei [...] is estimated by the Office for Protection of the Constitution at 150 members. Yet while ingratiating himself with Busse, Ron Furey was shown Busse's list - 980 members. [...] 2. While the government estimates that another group, the Nationale Offensive, has 100 members, Ron Furey found out that the Dresden area cell alone has 150. 3. Meinolf Schoenborn's ""Nationalistic Front,"" which is also banned, is estimated at 130 members. Schoenborn claims an infrastructure of 8,600. [...]""<37> The authorities are able, given sufficient proof, to declare a party to be anti-constitutional under article 21, paragraph 2 of the Basic Law. This states that: ""(2) 1.Parties which, according to their aims or relationship of their supporters, are intent on interfering with or removing the free democratic basic order or threatening the continued existence of the Federal Republic of Germany, are anti-constitutional. 2.The decision of anti-constitutionalism lies with the Federal Constitutional Court."" Such an example of this is the recent ban imposed on the FAP. According to paragraph 33 (Ban of Replacement Organizations), article 1 of the Party Law: ""It is forbidden to form organizations (replacement organizations), which persue further anti-constitutional aims in place of a party banned under article 21, paragraph 2 of the Basic Law in conjunction with article 46 of the Law of the Constitutional Court, or to continue existing organizations as replacement organizations."" Any offending individuals are liable to forfeit certain Basic Rights, in accordance with article 18 of the Basic Law, although such motions have to be initiated by the Bundestag, the Federal Government or a regional government. The Office for the Protection of the Constitution is the official organization charged with monitoring the right-wing extremist groups, currently with a budget of over 200 million Marks. Geoffrey K. Roberts sees this office as ""institutionalised wariness"" in the light of the 1920s. It has set up three working parties to investigate the problems of right-wing extremism: a group on right-wing terrorism; a group for special measures for fighting right-wing extremism and the Information Group for the Observation and Combatting of Right-wing Extremist Violence. The Office for the Protection of the Constitution can either have a party banned or declared anti-constitutional, which prevents all members of that party from working in the civil service, which would otherwise allow individuals a platform to air their extremist views. 9.0 Public Reaction Perhaps the most obvious and most violent opposition to the right-wing extremists comes from the one diametrically opposed group: the left-wing extremists. The militant left-wingers have demonstrated against the right-wing extremists on numerous occasions, most notably after the 1992 rioting in Rostock, where the left-wingers were immediately arrested when they gathered to attack the right-extremists as they were attacking a home for asylum seekers. Organised around the theme Antifaschismus/Antirassismus, there are several localised groups which take on the right-wing. In 1993 the report of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution recorded 337 violent attacks on the far-right, compared with 390 in 1992. The ordinary citizen has protested vociferously: after the rioting throughout Germany in 1992, the masses turned out to show their feelings on the subject in several town and cities across the country, but especially in those places where the rioting had occurred. In Berlin on November 8th 1992, the eve of the 54th anniversary of Reichskristallnacht, the Nazi purge of the Jews, 300,000 people, among them Federal President Richard von Weizsaecker, protested against right-wing violence in the Berliner Lustgarten, although the demonstration was later disrupted by anarchists.<38> 10.0 Conclusion Whilst it cannot be denied that right-wing extremism and right-wing violence have increased over the past decade, one must question the comments of some critics of Germany, that the Government has just ""stood by and watched"". It is a difficult and dangerous situation which has developed in Germany, and the utmost care needs to be exercised in dealing with it, in order to avoid an escalation of the violence and an increase in the number of subversive groups. The problem with banning individual parties, as has been found in the past, is that it simply drives the activities of the banned group underground, or else, as with the ANS/NA, the members join a similarly oriented group, such as the FAP. Additionally, as Manfred Kanther, the Interior Minister, stated of Die Republikaner, to ban a party is merely to make martyrs of those in the party hierarchy. Thus, by not banning the parties, not only does the Government have a much clearer idea of each individual group and, hence, its membership, but it is also easier for it to monitor the practices of the groups and, to a certain extent, to control them.

If he hadn’t taken off that would have been the end of it.’’ Welcome to the public sphere, Mr. Tager. Glad to hear you speaking your mind. We at BMG might recommend, from prior experience, that you do not come by here and express yourself. A defense lawyer might take an interest. Tager also said he hopes the crash – and Galluccio’s response to it – prompts the 42-year-old to get some assistance. “I think he has some issues that he needs to get help with,’’ said Tager. Yeah, that's long overdue. Someone I was talking to brought this up: This happened in Cambridge. There are, like, trains, buses, and cabs in Cambridge.

sunday,"No. 17. ATLANTA, GEORGIA. MARCH, 1890. Issued monthly during term time from the University printing office. Entered at the Atlanta, 6a., post office as second class mail matter. Subscriptions at 25 cents a year may be sent to the treasurer of Atlanta University, Atlanta. Ga. Atlanta University, Atlanta, Ga., Has G50 students in College, Normal, College Preparatory, Grammar, and Primary departments, with practical instruction in wood-working, iron-working' farming, printing, cooking, sewing, and nursing, under the care of 28 officers and instructors, in four large brick buildings, surrounded by 60 acres of land within the corporate limits of Atlanta, the land,\buildings, and outfit valued at a quarter of a million dollars; with 200 graduates from College and Normal courses nearly all of'whom, together with many hundreds of past undergraduates, are engaged in teaching and other useful work in Georgia and surrounding States. Having practically no endowment, the Institution requires at least $18,000 a year in donations from its friends to continue the work now in hand, and a fund of about $250,000 to put that work on a permanent basis. Remittances of checks or money orders, or inquiries for further information, may be addressed to, Pres. HORACE BUMSTEAD, D. D., Atlanta, Ga., FORTY-DOLLAR SCHOLARSHIPS. Annual scholarships in institutions like Atlanta University may be applied in two ways. One way is to supplement the meager resources of some deserving boarding student so that he may meet the charges for his board and tuition. These charges are ten dollars a month, or eighty dollars a year. Only in very rare cases is aid given to the extent of more than one half, and in many cases less than that amount is sufficient. A forty-dollar scholarship, then, will secure the attendance of one boarding student for one year, and in some cases will meet the necessities of two or even three. All boarding students thus aided do extra daily work for the benefit of the Institution in consideration of the aid received. Fifty of these forty-dollar scholarships will at present provide all the funds needed for this purpose. The other method of using a forty-dollar scholarship, is to cover the actual cost of the tuition of one student for one year. Both the boarding students and the day students pay a tuition fee, but it is only nominal—one dollar a month, or eight dollars a year. A fair estimate of the cost of this tuition over and above tuition fees received from the students is forty dollars. This estimate is based on the amounts paid in salaries to the teachers, which the University has no endowment funds to meet, together with the cost of the general maintenance of the work not provided for in other ways. Four hundred such scholarships of forty dollars each would for the present be sufficient. Fifty times forty dollars equals $2,000 —the amount needed to aid boarding students. Four hundred times forty dollars equals $16,000—the amount needed to cover the actual cost of tuition. Two thousand dollars and sixteen thousand dollars equals $18,000—the total amount needed in annual donations. Good reader—merchant, perhaps, prospered in your business—will you not, in one or the other of the ways just indicated, assume the support of one young man in Atlanta University? Will not the thought of such a service rendered to ""one of the least of these"" be a rich return for the forty dollars thus expended ? Good wife and mother, will you not join with your husband and send another ""forty"" for the years' training of one young woman—one who is destined, most likely, to be a wife and mother like yourself, and to whom Atlanta University alone can supply such training for wifehood and motherhood as your own better informed mother and richer home-life supplied to you ? And will not the children, too, come to the aid of one more boy or girl who is just as eager as they are to get a good start in life, and who needs that good start a great deal more, perhaps, in view of the greater obstacles that impede the progress of these sons and daughters of the Freed-man ? But if father, mother and children cannot each have a student to represent them, perhaps the Sunday"
sunday,"There's still a lot of buzz about Ruby on Rails and I've played around with it but I really don't like the Ruby syntax. I've tried a few different Rails packages and just find the experience... clunky. Lots of people are very excited about Rails and Ruby in general, especially with JRuby (Ruby for Java) now running Rails. In fact, Maxim Porges thinks JRuby has taken ColdFusion's place as the new web productivity layer for Java, after watching Charles Nutter demo JRuby at the acts_as_conference Rails conference recently in Florida.Another scripting language that people seem to like is Groovy and there is now a Rails-like framework for Groovy called, unsurprisingly, Grails. Derek Perez likes Groovy and has asked me several times to add support for Groovy to my Scripting for ColdFusion 8 project. Raffaele Castagno, an Italian Groovy fan, even sent me custom tags and instructions for adding it to the project back in August last year but I never got around to it. Then Dave Ross said the other night that he thought Grails was going to do very well for Java developers who don't like Ruby's syntax. Since that was my main objection, I figured it was a good time to actually look at Grails. The Grails site has a simple installation page with two options: download and install or install from Subversion. The latter sounded like fun for a Sunday"

The particular battle over evolution was already won by 1884"" (F. A. Iremonger, William Temple, Archbishop of Canterbury, His Life and Letters [London: Oxford Univ. Press, 1948], p. 491). To a large extent it would seem that evolution has been tacitly accepted and essentially ignored within such circles, although there has been a significant number of serious attempts to integrate evolutionary understanding into theology. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin provides a famous example, as does biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky. For more than twenty years the pages of Zygon, to cite an obvious example, have carried notable contributions from scientists and theologians.

Atlanta has won five of six heading into a regular season-ending three-game trip.""We're finally meshing,"" guard Armintie Price said Tuesday after a 77-61 victory over Seattle. ""It's late in the season to do it. But the best time to do it.""The Dream, a season-best three games above .500, can match the franchise record for wins set in 2011 if they win out, but a title is the goal after they were swept in the finals each of the last two postseasons.While Atlanta will likely need big production from Angel McCoughtry, the league's leading scorer with 21.7 points per game, the club has played well lately with McCoughtry coming off the bench following a two-game absence for personal reasons and a two-game ban for violating an unspecified team rule.""(Coming off the bench is) what I did in the Olympics,"" said McCoughtry, a gold medal winner with the U.S. team. ""It doesn't matter.""What does matter is that the Dream are sharing the ball and getting everyone involved. Of their 197 field goals in the last six games, 117 have come off assists. Atlanta recorded 20 assists on 29 field goals Tuesday.""The team shared the basketball again,"" said coach Fred Williams, who is 5-2 since taking over for the fired Marynell Meadors. ""It's starting to come for us. We want to play that kind of basketball and play well.""The Dream have played that way in three matchups with the Mystics (5-25) in 2012, handing out 68 assists on 100 field goals and winning by an average of 20.0 points.Lindsey Harding is averaging team highs with 15.7 points and 6.3 assists in those contests after scoring 15 points with nine assists in Atlanta's 93-68 home win Sunday"

He built for him a beautiful convent in the park of Plessis, in a place called Montils: and another at Amboise, and upon the very spot where he met him when he was dauphin: and going to Rome in 1495, where he made a triumphant entry, and was saluted Emperor of Constantinople by Pope Alexander VI., he built there, on Mount Pincio, a stately monastery for this Order, under the name of the Blessed Trinity, in which none but Frenchmen can be admitted. In his reign the saint founded the convent of Nigeon, near Paris, on which occasion two doctors, who had violently opposed the institute before the bishop of Paris, were so moved by the sight of the saint at Plessis, that they entered his Order in 1506. Pope Julius II. again approved the rule, in which the saint had made some alterations. King Charles VIII. dying in 1498, Lewis XII. succeeded him. He at first gave the saint leave to return to Italy; but quickly recalled it, and heaped honours and benefactions on all his relations.

sunday,"Vietnam has no state religion, and adherence to a religion is not permitted for party members. According to some estimates, nearly three-fourths of the population of 70 million people are Buddhists, but the Government has claimed that only 6 million of these actually practice their religion. The Vatican believes that some 6 million Vietnamese are Catholic; a much smaller number are Protestant. Virtually all foreign clergy remaining in the south in 1975 were expelled at the end of that year. While the SRV has permitted visits by foreign clergy, it has not been willing to permit them to reside permanently for religious purposes in Vietnam. Reports indicate that religious groups are allowed freedom in their activities to the degree that they cooperate with the Government. Buddhism was afforded increasing tolerance until the Unified Buddhists (An Quang sect) began to protest government control through 1992. The tension increased in early 1993 when the arrest and confinement of numbers of middle- and low-level leaders sent a clear signal to the Buddhist hierarchy that they cannot challenge the Government. While restrictions on religious organizations are usually severe, they vary widely by locality. This is also true of church attendance. Many people report they have generally been free to attend worship services since 1975, and, during the past few years, visitors to Vietnam have reported that attendance at religious services is growing. Churches in and around Ho Chi Minh City and elsewhere have been observed overflowing during Sunday"

The Hoyas limited the Huskies to 30.0 percent from the field and 2-for-20 shooting from 3-point range in a 58-44 victory.""We did respond really well,"" said senior guard Jason Clark, who averages a team-best 15.4 points. ""We know what we did wrong in the game to lose at Pitt. We didn't want the same thing to happen.""While the defense bounced back, Hollis Thompson broke out of his brief offensive funk, scoring 18 on 7-of-15 shooting. The junior forward, who averages 14.0 points, combined for 15 on 6-of-17 shooting in his previous two games.Replicating his latest effort could be difficult, however, as South Florida (13-9, 6-3) is allowing a Big East-low 59.0 points per game -- narrowly ahead of Georgetown's 59.2.While both teams excel defensively, the Hoyas are capable of putting up some points, too. They rank in the middle of the conference in scoring, averaging 70.8, while the Bulls score a league-worst 62.1 per game.South Florida's inability to put teams away has led to trouble in games it seemingly could win.The Bulls are only 10-5 when limiting opponents to 60 points or fewer, while the Hoyas are 12-0 in such contests.The teams were pitted in a tight defensive struggle in last season's lone meeting and Georgetown prevailed 61-55. South Florida's Augustus Gilchrist had 22 points on 10-of-16 shooting, but the rest of the team was 13 of 43 from the floor (30.2 percent) while misfiring on 10 of 11 from beyond the arc.The Hoyas have won four of the last five against the Bulls, but suffered a 72-64 loss as the country's seventh-ranked team in the last one at the Verizon Center on Feb. 3, 2010.South Florida is coming off one of its best offensive games of the season, but it came against a Providence team that has been struggling to stop Big East opponents.The Bulls shot 50.9 percent and matched a season low with five turnovers in Sunday"

After a brief stop at his own home, where he picked up some personal belongings, Sickles and a crew of prominent friends, including the mayor of Washington, James Berret, rode to the city jail. There he stoutly declined bail, declaring that his only wish was a swift trial. If the Congressman suspected his incarceration would not hurt his cause, he was right. His transfer to the warden’s quarters after four days of fighting bedbugs in the jail was ignored by the public, who seized upon Sickles as a heroic defender of family honor. (The prisoner did himself no harm by asking for, and getting, a visit with his five-year-old daughter, Laura, and later calling for the company of his pet greyhound, Dandy.) Few if any stopped to consider the weight of official power and wealth on Sickles’ side. His strong friendship with the President dated from his service as secretary of legation during Buchanan’s ambassadorship to the Court of St. James’s. In addition, Sickles had in his three years in Washington won a significant niche in the upper reaches of capital society. His ample house, known as the Stockton mansion, shared Lafayette Park with the handsome residences of the Adamses, the Taylors, the Blairs, the Slidells. This elite, plus scores of other Cabinet and congressional notables, had flocked to Sickles’ Thursday night “at-homes,” where the food and drink, served by the incomparable Gautier, king of the capital’s caterers, were invariably first class. Presiding over these occasions, bedecked in magnificent jewelry and wearing the latest gowns, was Sickles’ young, darkly beautiful wife, Teresa. It was frequently claimed that the thirty-nine-year-old Sickles, an aristocrat in his own right with the blood of Knickerbockers and Van Sicklens in his veins and a millionaire father in New York, had his eyes on the Presidency. This dream had vanished, of course, in the roar of his pistol on that fatal Sunday"
